2 Imagine thinking this applies to you, a basement dwelling Redditor with absolutely no interest or knowledge in world conflicts other than this ‚Äúholly war‚Äù fad that you‚Äôve been brainwashed to support, and not the front line soldiers actually fighting and involved in the movements. I know so many of you have a lot of free time and have whole heartedly and ignorantly thrown your support into a war that doesn‚Äôt effect or involve you, so I understand wanting to feel like your doing something by making post like this when you‚Äôre really not having any effect on this war at all. Keep reeeeing ‚Äúopsec‚Äù if it really makes you feel better.

181 It's a reference to lord of the rings but there's more to it than that. Lord of the Rings was thought to be an allegory for the contemporary political climate in Europe in the early 50s with Sauron and Orcs in the east being the Soviet Union looking to invade the peaceful and cultured people's in the west.

A Russian wrote a paper basically trying to make an argument that the Orcs and Sauron were misunderstood and unfairly persecuted in the books just like the USSR is.

187 This is an amazing amount of pure leadership, grace under pressure. If not for this man they probably would have gotten over run. 

He runs up to the burm and starts very calmly just doing his job. Then he directs the men to come out. And then he's directing the defense. 

Lead by example, give clear orders. Adjust accordingly to direct the defense and coordinate with other platoon leaders.

I've said it before, but regardless of what he claims he had a choice.  He could have turned his gun on the one giving the order.   He could have turned the gun on himself.  Either would have been immeasurably preferable.

But instead he chose to murder small children and infants.

219 I hope this human scum deep down knows that those orders don't take any guilt away from him! If he is ordered to shoot unarmed men, women and children, it's still him who pulls the trigger, not his commander. He feared repercussions or to die himself, in the case he disobeyed, that's all. He simply chose egoism over moralism, but now he's too ashamed about himself to actually acknowledge or confess it. So now he's trying to look like he got a conscience and ethics, but he already proofed if it's him or his morals, he will always chooses himself, turning his morals into an empty fa√ßade! Normal, civilized people would rather die themselves than killing a small child, or they at least have the decency to shoot themself as soon as they realise what they have done! This aberration of nature deserves nothing but to be spit at an be buried in an unmarked grave to be forever forgotten by mankind and history!

452 Brazil's Lula: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
453 > "When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_687

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1441

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973

The UN explicitly okayed military action against Iraq in the 1990‚Äôs, and condemned and sanctioned Iraq regularly. Many argue the 2003 invasion was illegal under international law, but the UN Security Council was absolutely discussing and condemning Iraq up until the invasion. The UN Security Council also explicitly voted for a no fly zone over Libya.

454 By Lula's logic, the UN created the state of Turkey 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
455 As others have pointed out, the UN did not create Israel. They proposed a partition plan which would have created two states. This plan failed, because while the Israelis accepted it, the Arabs and surrounding Arab states did not - they declared war, and lost. 

Israel wasn‚Äôt created by the UN, it was created by its population, who fought a successful war.  

As an example of UN past strength, this episode doesn‚Äôt exactly shine. 

Even worse was to come, though. After a war in 1956, and sundry continuing hostilities, the UN placed a peacekeeping force separating Egypt and Israel. In 1967, the President of Egypt, Nasser, believed he had a good shot at defeating Israel for good - so he demanded this force leave, to clear the way for his victorious army (in point of fact, Nasser‚Äôs actual motives may have been as much, or more, to demonstrate his authority by making the demand - it isn‚Äôt clear whether he thought it would be obeyed). Spinelessly, the UN simply agreed to remove its peacekeeping force - and in the war that resulted, Egypt was once again trounced. 

What finally secured peace was not the UN, but a series of deals brokered by the US which saw Israel handing back the land it took in that war (after yet another war in which Egypt was defeated, but after a much harder fight). 

What this demonstrated to everyone in the vicinity was not UN potency, but rather the opposite.

460 Palestine was created simultaneously with Israel. The Palestinians refused their state, attacked Israel, and lost.

Clinton leaned *hard* on Israel at Camp David. The Palestinians were offered basically everything they claimed to want. Arafat refused and launched the Second Intifada.

The reason the Palestinians don't have their own country is because they've never wanted their own country, they want the abolition of Israel and (at best) the expulsion of all Jews therein.

Peaceful coexistence has always been on offer for the Palestinians. They're not interested.

511 The problem in Sudan and in many African countries, is best described as Colonialism-by-Proxy. Unlike the past where Colonialism was where an invading country physically settled and exploited an African country, this new Colonialism is where a foreign country exploits an underdeveloped African country by putting, empowering and legitimizing generals/dictators/despots that do their bidding in power.

In Sudan, these two currently warring Generals are tools put up and used by Russian and Arabian interest to exploit the country and its resources without them being exposed.

Through these two generals they have quelled and sabotaged any efforts by the sudanese people to transition into a democracy. A democracy will protect the country interest and develop it‚Äôs people into a just, fair and prosperous society. Russian and Arabian interests will lose supply of resources, thus they do not want that.

This is the cycle throughout African countries: The people rise and overturn their corrupt governments, only to have a potentially brutal young dictator, basically a puppet, being propped and supported by foreign countries with interests take over.

The people who fought hard for democracy and development always, always lose at the end.

647 Brazil to step up removal of indigenous land invaders after Yanomami killing 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
648 Brazil will increase efforts to remove the remainder of wildcat miners from indigenous lands following a shooting attack by invaders that killed a Yanomami indigenous person and left two others seriously injured, the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples said on Sunday.

An inter-ministerial delegation is en route to Roraima state to "further reinforce actions to remove criminals," the ministry said on Twitter.

Since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in January, its administration has announced actions to remove thousands of illegal miners from the country's largest indigenous reservation in northern Brazil.

However, "many coordinated actions are still needed," the ministry said, noting it has requested support from the Ministry of Justice to investigate the shooting.

Federal Police said in note it was aware that indigenous individuals allegedly clashed with miners on Saturday. The authorities are working to identify, locate and apprehend those responsible for the crimes, it added.

The Yanomami people, estimated to number about 28,000, have faced a humanitarian crisis, including disease, sexual abuse and violence, due to the invasion of over 20,000 miners in their region, leading to malnutrition and deaths.

Lula's government declared a medical emergency for the Yanomamis earlier this year and pledged zero tolerance for mining on indigenous reservation land protected by Brazil's Constitution.

705 I love the reddit diplomats here acting like this is such a ridiculous request Canada will laugh at. It‚Äôs not. Canada has far more to gain from adjusting a visa policy for Mexicans than it does from pissing the U.S. off. And Canada perfectly understands the issue, it could barely handle a tiny flow of immigrants coming from NYC into Quebec, much less than 2+ million the US sees in a year. 

I personally disagree with the immigration direction we‚Äôre taking, and in favor of easier and streamlined access to the US. But that‚Äôs not how the politics are going to work out.

708 It sounds reasonable to me that the US and Canada have a similar/coordinated immigration policy, since they‚Äôre the only two developed countries in the Americas, and the only two developed countries to allow citizenship by birth in their territories. The US absorbs the bulk of poor, desperate immigrants from Latin America, and by doing so it shields Canada from a huge problem. Collaboration between both is extremely important

787 A war for our age: how the battle for Sudan is being fuelled by forces far beyond its borders 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
788 > Most reporting from Sudan has so far focused on the street battles in the capital, the 500 or more dead and 4,000 wounded, the impending humanitarian crisis and the evacuation of foreign nationals. But though the supply lines running through the desert are a detail in the grand scheme of things, they may tell us more about the nature of this conflict than breathless reports from Stansted as British evacuees arrive back in the UK or briefings from Washington.

>The trucks are carrying fuel from a refinery near the Libyan oasis town of al-Jawf ‚Äì as well as smaller consignments of ammunition, weapons and medicine ‚Äì to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which is currently battling regular army units under the control of Sudan‚Äôs de facto military ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. They are being sent by Khalifa Haftar, a warlord who runs much of eastern Libya. Other supplies, including potent Kornet anti-tank missiles looted from Libyan government stocks more than a decade ago, have been transported by air, say witnesses at al-Jawf‚Äôs airport.

>The RSF is loyal to Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (usually referred to as Hemedti), a former camel trader who started his career in charge of a notoriously brutal militia in Sudan‚Äôs south-west before graduating to industrial-scale gold smuggling and massacring pro-democracy protesters. Haftar is sending the supplies because his sponsors among states in the Middle East have asked him to and because it earns him a lot of money. A warlord in one conflict helps out another in a second, at the behest of a distant power.

‚Ä¶

> The trucks across the desert tell us more. Haftar has offered assistance but has carefully balanced his need to please supporters in the United Arab Emirates, who are key partners in the gold business with Hemedti, but without annoying his other sponsors in Egypt, who are backing Burhan. Thus the need to keep the oil convoys quiet, and the precautions taken to mask the diversion of around 10,000 barrels a day of Libyan oil from a state company which is then turned into high quality fuel at the al-Sarir refinery and trucked to Hemedti‚Äôs fuel-thirsty forces, according to former senior Libyan officials with access to intelligence files.

>Of course, this assistance is not freely offered and the fuel is sold not given to the RSF, generating vast revenues for Haftar‚Äôs extended family and businesses. The gold goes out, the fuel comes in, all paid for in massive transfers of money. This is a wartime expansion of a lucrative existing business partnership running for a decade or more. Are any laws broken? Probably. Can anyone stop the traffic? Almost certainly not. Will it bring victory to Hemedti? Unlikely. Will it prolong the conflict? Definitely.

> The trucks do not move through a geopolitical vacuum. The UAE‚Äôs support for Hemedti and Haftar is based on rivalry with other Middle Eastern states and financial gain. Moscow, true to its broad strategy of backing the most obvious disruptors in order to profit financially and politically from the resultant chaos, has also been supporting Hemedti and the RSF for years. Here the Russians are doing what they have done across the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa ‚Äì adding a hefty dose of disinformation to the Sudanese mix for good measure. They are keen on Indian ocean naval bases ‚Äì another echo of Syria, where access to the Mediterranean was a key strategic consideration. Saudi Arabia has an interest in heading off regional rivals, and gaining access to the vast agricultural resources of Sudan. Egypt is unsurprisingly keen on an authoritarian military regime in their southern neighbour so wants Burhan to win. The Chinese seek advantage against the US, votes at the UN and the kudos that comes with successful mediation. And so on, in concentric circles, out to the western Europeans, the UK and the US. All have their interests, if not their chosen favourites.

793 __Celebrations took place on Saturday along the Rhine River on the invisible border between the Alpine country and the small principality to mark the creation of a single economic area with the signing of the Customs Treaty on March__

Political and business figures had already celebrated the anniversary at a gala evening in late March. The event on Saturday was held for the local communities in the two countries.

According to the Liechtenstein National Police, around 6,000 people gathered on the two Rhine bridges between Sevelen in¬†canton St. Gallen and Vaduz in Liechtenstein to sample music, St. Gallen bratwurst, Liechtenstein beer and the Engadiner nut¬†tart (B√ºndner Nusstorte).

Those in attendance included Liechtenstein Head of Government Daniel Risch, Hereditary Prince Alois and his wife, Princess¬†Sophie, and Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter.

Keller-Sutter told the crowd that ‚Äúboth countries have benefited greatly from the open borders.‚Äù A prosperous cross-border business and residential space had emerged in the Rhine Valley and on Lake Constance, she said, and become¬†a leader in Europe in networking, economic power and innovation.

"Our customs treaty was blazing trails¬†far in advance of the worldwide liberalisation efforts of the past decades," the minister said.

Liechtenstein had been hit hard economically by the effects of the First World War because of its close ties to Austria. With the Customs Treaty, trade and customs agreements concluded by Switzerland with third countries automatically applied to Liechtenstein as well. The small state (which now has a population of 39,000) was thus integrated into the global economy through Swiss foreign trade policy. Liechtenstein adopted the Swiss Franc in 1924.

"The Customs Treaty opened the gateway to the world for us," Deputy Head of Government Sabine Monauni told the press in the run-up to the anniversary.

During the event on Saturday, an art exhibition was opened on and around the old Rhine bridge. On display are installations created especially for the anniversary by artists from both sides of the border and that can be seen until July 31.

> In past decades, studies into Switzerland&#039;s complex role during the Second World War have revealed how embedded the country, and particularly its banks and financial institutions, were with Nazi Germany and the rest of the Axis powers.

> Finally, while estimates do vary, the Bergier Commission set up by the government in the 1990s found that up to 24.500 people who fled to Switzerland during the war were returned to Nazi Germany, most of whom were Jewish.

I'm guessing that's more money than the Swiss government spent on actually fighting Nazis....since they were neutral in the war and profited off the gold the Nazis stole. Have to wonder how many melted down fillings from the teeth of Holocaust victims ended up in Swiss banks? I'll bet it was a lot more than 2.5 million francs.

825 In the lead up to WWII many Jewish families moved their assets to Swiss banks and had their children memorize the account numbers. When Jewish survivors went to recover that money they were told they needed to provide a death certificate. Which was impossible since the Nazi's never issued them. So the survivors got nothing.

In the 1980's a Swiss Bank guard was ordered to shred boxes of documents. He got curious and looked in one of the boxes and saw they were the old records of Jewish account holders form before the war. He took those records to the authorities.

Switzerland is just as complicit as the Nazi's if not more so because the profited for the death of millions and have never provided restitution to the survivors they turned away.

837 JERUSALEM, April 30 (Reuters) - An Israeli army officer was removed from his post on Sunday for attending a political protest in uniform, the first such case during a crisis over the government's planned judicial overhaul that has stirred rancour within the military ranks.

Local media identified the officer as a major who was televised carrying a stretcher in a publicity stunt during a pro-government rally that was convened on Thursday in an attempt to off-set months of demonstrations against the reforms.

885 Every military in the world punishes its soldiers for desertion and drunkenness on duty.  Usually with imprisonment.

Of course "the brig" in most countries is usually a proper, permanent prison facility, not a foxhole and some chicken wire looted from the Ukrainian equivalent of Home Depot.

But when you're on the front lines, and your economy's been wrecked by sanctions, and your troops have piss-poor discipline at the best of times, and the war's going poorly, so there's lots of soldiers who need to be punished... corners must be cut.

Don't get me wrong, Russia's done plenty of terrible things in this war.  But this particular policy is more in line with the normal business of military and warfare.  I don't think it's a moral outrage or crime against humanity.

There were many "law and order" signs greeting him.  (Part of the bs campaign was built on bs law and order and that was possibly pre-election.)  Can someone please explain this to me?

I wanted to see if murdoch was invading the Aussies, so I did a search of news online.  I landed on a website that was saying the same lies that were being propagated here (still couldn't tell it was murdoch but it smelled of him).  Then I either did a media bias check or checked something to find out who owned it.  It was murdoch (I think a bit over 50%) and obviously right or extremist-leaning.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
1016 For my fellow US readers, these protesters are fighting for our democracy, too. The anti-democracy movement is interconnected globally. 

It may not be a coincidence that China has chosen this moment to offer mediation between Israel and the Palestinians, to exploit the divisions within Israeli society over this far right judicial agenda, and by that means exploit the divisions between Biden and Netanyahu. 

Whichever the case, these protests are significant for all of us:

The Trump Campaign‚Äôs Collusion With Israel: While US media fixated on Russian interference in the 2016 election, an Israeli secret agent‚Äôs campaign to influence the outcome went unreported.

https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-israel-collusion/

"'Roger, hello from Jerusalem,' read the message from the Israeli secret agent. Dated August 12, 2016, it was addressed to Roger Stone‚Äîat the time a key player in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential election campaign. ‚ÄúAny progress? He is going to be defeated unless we intervene. We have critical intel. The key is in your hands! Back in the US next week.‚Äù Later, the agent promised, ‚ÄúOctober Surprise coming!‚Äù'

..."The key for the Israeli agent was finding a back door‚Äîa covert channel‚Äîto Trump. Roger Stone, long a key Trump aide, fit the bill. Although Stone had formally left the campaign, he and Trump spoke frequently and confidentially. For these calls, Trump would often use the phone of his security director, Keith Schiller, ‚Äúbecause he did not want his advisers to know they were talking,‚Äù according to Sam Nunberg, a political adviser who served on Trump‚Äôs 2016 election campaign. Stone energetically supported Israel‚Äôs harsh occupation of the Palestinian territories and its bellicose stance toward Iran; following Trump‚Äôs speech at an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in March 2016, Stone noted approvingly that ‚ÄúDonald Trump is a radical Zionist.‚Äù

 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
1025 I address you, the Members of the Seventy-seventh Congress, at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union. I use the word "unprecedented," because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today.

Let us say to the democracies: "We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom. We are putting forth our energies, our resources and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world. We shall send you, in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. This is our purpose and our pledge."

Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be. When the dictators, if the dictators, are ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part. They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war.

Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is our unity of purpose. To that high concept there can be no end save victory.

> Britons are feared to have been stranded in Sudan following reports that the country&#039;s armed forces had prevented a number of people from reaching the last rescue flights out of the war-torn country on Saturday.

> Kearns&#039;s bleak update followed fresh airstrikes and artillery fire in the Sudanese capital, and came amid mounting concern over the broader humanitarian disaster unfolding on Sudan&#039;s borders, with thousands waiting for days in the open air to enter Egypt, or walking hundreds of miles to cross into South Sudan.

> Moneer Abdel Mohsen, a Sudanese citizen who fled across the Egyptian border and took a flight back to the United Arab Emirates after a trip to Sudan to see friends, said he had waited a day and a half at the border crossing.

1142 That's a bold assumption. There is war inside the city. We don't know they prevent them from entering the city because of the heavy fighting, or it's because they want to use them as hostages, or want them to stay and get killed, hence, the request to look into it. We still don't know what's going on, down there. It's a war zone.

The US asked all citizens to stay home. I think that asking UK citizens to risk their lives to reach the airport is a huge mistake. If the UK wants to save them, save them the right way, without asking them to play Russian roulette. Do not forget this car full of kids destroyed by the Americans in Kabul. There is no need to make another remake, getting killed by Sudanese soldiers or rebels.

> The U.S., which had none of its officials on the ground for the evacuation, has been criticized by families of trapped Americans in Sudan for initially ruling out any U.S.-run evacuation for those among an estimated 16,000 Americans in Sudan who wish to leave.

> Since the conflict between two rival generals broke out April 15, the U.S. has warned its citizens that they needed to find their own way out of the country, though U.S. officials have tried to link up Americans with other nations&#039; evacuation efforts.

> Without the evacuation flights near the capital that other countries have been offering their citizens, many U.S. citizens have been left to make the dangerous overland journey from Khartoum to the country&#039;s main Red Sea port, Port Sudan.

1279 Saudi-flagged ship evacuates over 1,900 people from conflict-ridden Sudan to Jeddah 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
1280 As a Sudanese, what is happening in the country is really sad and depressing, like two bastards, one is the head of Sudanese Armed Forces, and the other is the head of a major paramilitary organization known as RSF, fighting for power when basically non of them is supposed to rule. It was supposed to be a civilian ( democratic ) government when this  started happening. i basically wake up to hear my mother telling me that fighting is going on, i never thought it would be that serious until when people started moving away from their homes to go outside Sudan's capital, Khartoum to some faraway cities or countries, especially Egypt. 

Imagine now hearing that forces from the RSF coming in and stealing stuff from houses, and that forces, majority of them RSF, taking shelter in people's evacuated houses. 

Back to the topic, yes Saudi Arabia is evacuating people, but probably only their citizens and permanent resident, yes Saudi Arabia helped people from other countries evacuate on their ships dispatched to Port Sudan, but what about those millions of Sudanese who cant find a way out?

> After days of wrangling, it was then agreed that women working in the health aid sector would be exempt from the decree, before the Taliban authorities&#039; ruling banning the Afghan women UN workers earlier this month.

1305 Sudan crisis risks becoming a nightmare for the world - former PM Hamdok 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
1306 Sudan has been a global nightmare since the tyrannical and genocidal rule of Omar Al-Bashir, the secession of South Sudan and Al-Bashir's downfall were seen as events that made the country move towards the path of democracy only to be thwarted by the 2021 coup and the current infighting. The problem lies in the fact that most of Al-Bashir former generals and commanders retained their positions and influence due the country's practically inexistant institutions and generalized violence.

The position of the country in a key location in Africa due to the Nile's large water supplies and the ongoing conflict between Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt regarding water adds another conflict to an already dangerous conflict. The Tigray War and the constant insurgency at Chad, worse since Idriss Deby's assassination make Central and East Africa an extremely unstable region and the future birthplace of an even larger humanitarian crisis than the current one.

The EU should be particularly careful of this as a worse refugee crisis at a point where the Ukraine caused major economic insecurity due to inflation and shortages in some areas. Their infrastucture could be overwhelmed and new political tensions could emerge with enough potential to create more fractures inside the continental entity. Too many players are involved in this situation and everyone can be negatively affected so Africa must become a major focus in the West's geopolitical agenda in order to maintain stability at a global level, even if it involves cooperation with China, the major economic player of Africa.

1329 The whole thing about surrendering a passport really pisses me off, especially with employers confiscating them in some countries.  I've also heard about third world hotels keeping them in order to run them by local police overnight, though maybe that's a thing from the old days.  There should be an international treaty that passports are never to be taken under any circumstances unless it's to surrender it to one's own country for a new one.  If some office wants a copy, that's fine, they can scan it.

Of course nothing will ever be done about it, I'm sure.

* Erdogan *had* their support, because Erdogan *had* opened up some freedoms for women.
* Time has passed though, and now Erdogan *is* holding freedoms back from women.

> Originally, the official approach of the French government was to study the potential return of minors from Syria or Iraq &quot;On a case-by-case basis,&quot; without authorizing the return of adults.

> For attorney Marie Dos&eacute;, who supports women and children held in camps in northeastern Syria, the registry is also a &quot;Form of stigmatization.&quot; In an interview with broadcaster France Info, the lawyer indicated that she is studying the possibility of appealing the decree with other lawyers in an attempt to have it revoked.

1603 This is actually a very interesting case study for criminal law, and ethics. In countries with capital punishment, how would you deal with a subject that is pregnant? Depending on how a country's laws determine the personhood of a fetus, issuing a swift death sentence would be killing an innocent along with the guilty. Should a death sentence be carried out after the birth of the child? If not, after how much time? Answers may very depending on your outlook.

Government everyone had a job and food to eat and the country was prosperous as soon as you elect a black government all hell breaks loose and you end up back 100 years at the start and the country go's to shit, this has happened to every country in Africa and still the dumb fuckers haven't learnt and from what I read the white folks in SA have been brainwashed by the ANC (Mandela) and vote for the fuckers as well. Now you all face the issue of upcoming Sanctions that will be effected due to your government being ass lockers of Putin and his fucked up view of what the world should be.

1709 The Western Cape and the city don't even run the jails and prisons which falls under the national(federal authority). And City of Cape Town police are under equipped and mostly there to investigate noise complaints, issue spot fines for littering and transgressing city by laws and sometimes traffic control. What will happen is that the City of Cape Town police will disregard any order to arrest Putin since it would mean getting into a losing gun battle with the South African police and Special Task Force who are their colleagues that they work with everyday anyway.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
1716 The Iranian foreign minister confirmed President Ebrahim Raisi would visit Syria in "the near future" without providing details.  
The visit **would be the first by an Iranian president to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since war broke out in Syria in 2011.** With military help and economic support from both Iran and Russia, Assad was able to turn the tide of the conflict and regain control of most of his country. In Israel, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi sought to cast Iran‚Äôs diplomatic outreach as a response to what he described as its failure to contend with Israeli military strikes on its assets in Syria and elsewhere.

1717 **Saudi Arabia and Iran will reopen embassies in each other's capitals "within days,"** Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Friday in a sign of warming relations after the two countries closed their missions seven years ago.  
Speaking at a news conference in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Amirabdollahian did not give specific dates for the reopening of the embassies, which closed in 2016.

  
"During the last phone call between the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia on Eid al-Fitr, we agreed to work in the next coming days on the reopening of the Iranian and Saudi embassies in Tehran and Riyadh," Amirabdollahian said, according to an official Arabic translation.  
The regional rivals agreed last month to restore diplomatic relations under a deal brokered by China. Their relationship started deteriorating in 2015 following the intervention of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the Yemen war, after the Iran-aligned Houthi movement toppled the Saudi-backed government and seized control of the capital Sanaa.

1797 What are the options realistically? 

Intervention by the United Nations?

Intervention by the United States?

Putting aside the fact I seriously doubt Biden has any interest in getting involved with Haiti in any way beyond the usual superficial responses. I just don't see a solution here that will satisfy anyone.

You can't rebuild the institutions of a country if those institutions have disintegrated, and have no way to sustain themselves. I mean you would need to spend generations developing the kind of foundations necessary to make these sustainable. 

So.. annexation or occupation?  They're might be a practical argument if people could disassociate their feelings with colonialism, etc. It's just there is no chance of that happening, and no military power of capable size has any interest in taking on the challenge it would entail.

At this point the concept of Haiti as a country seems less and less likely and more like an area where whoever has more guns will become the leaders by default.

It's a human tragedy by any measure, I just don't see a solution that in the current political climate that would work.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
1865 What is the fighting about?

I‚Äôve read that one side agreed to allow Russia to build a naval port in Sudan on the Red Sea, and that opposition to this is being aided by western backed governments.

I‚Äôve also read, going a couple years back now, that a lot of the turmoil in Sudan has to do with controlling access to oil reserves.  Petronas, the Malaysian national oil company, has long been associated with oil production in Sudan, and there have been stories that they‚Äôve been very brutal in how their going about securing territory.

I‚Äôve also read that various oil companies, again mostly Petronas, were basically pitting Arab Sudanese against Black Sudanese.  Is there any validity to these stories?

I first became aware of the Petronas involvement because of F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, who was very supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, while being sponsored by Petronas, who people claimed was involved in harming and undermining Black people in Sudan.

1903 Four-right parties in negotiations to form government majority in Finland 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
1904 The presence of the Finns' Party in a government coalition is particularly troubling, it is almost a replica of what happened at Sweden with the alliance between the Moderates and the Sweden Democrats. There is an ongoing trend of a symbiosis between the traditional center-right conservative parties and the emergent far-right populist ones that could contribute to an US-like polarization in Europe. 

The EU must reach a consensus regarding the most important topics that affect the lives of the common people in order to prevent the rise of more populist movements, particularly a successful economic plan that ensures similar levels of wealth to all members of the EU and a realistic approach to multiculturalism and the integration of the immigrants to tone down the xenophobic rethoric against refugees. 

If the decision-making process continues to be overly complex the EU will have a perennially troubled existence, complete social and economic integration between the West and East must be the top priority and all voices must be given place through a respectful democratic process as well as participation in major decisions, including the management of the Euro and the possibility of alternative economic policies rather than the German-directed policies.

1960 Jair Bolsonaro questioned by police investigating Brazil coup attempt 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
1961 During a appearance on a television program, Bolsonaro was asked by a famous Afro-Brazilian actress, Preta Gil, what he would do if his son fell in love with a black woman.

He replied: **‚ÄúI do not run that risk because my sons are well educated"**

https://blackbraziltoday.com/preta-gil-jair-bolsonaro-and-the-promiscuous-stereotype-of-black-women/

In 2003, in the lower house of Brazil‚Äôs federal Congress, Maria do Ros√°rio ‚Äì a Congresswoman stood to praise the National Truth Commission. The Truth Commission was preparing to release a comprehensive report on the systematic human rights abuses perpetrated by the Brazilian Dictatorship.

Congresswoman do Ros√°rio described the military dictatorship as a source of ‚Äúabsolute shame‚Äù and condemned it for using murder, torture, rape and sexual abuse against dissidents.

After do Ros√°rio left the podium, Jair Bolsonaro declared

* **‚ÄúI would not rape you. You don‚Äôt merit that.‚Äù**

Then, in the hallways of the Brazilian Congress, Jair Bolsonaro screamed at her

* **"You are a dirty slut"**

And for good measure, he also pushed her, then told her to ‚Äúgo cry ! go cry! ‚Äù ‚Äì all in front of journalists who filmed the entire episode:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8-b4wvIjc

Yet in 2018, the Wall Street Journal publically ENDORSED him:

https://www.businessinsider.com/wsj-endorses-jair-bolsonaro-far-right-2018-10

Why? Because Bolsonaro promised to cut taxes on big corporations. So let's endorse a psycho.

> Bolsonaro spent more than two hours in the company of police investigators on Wednesday morning, nearly four months after thousands of hardcore supporters ran riot in the capital, Bras&iacute;lia, in what the new administration called a botched coup intended to reinstall the far-right former army captain as president.

> Brazilian media reports claimed Bolsonaro told investigators he had republished the video by mistake and while under the effect of morphine he had received after being taken to hospital in the US. Bolsonaro&#039;s lawyer, Daniel Tesser, told reporters the former president &quot;Rejected any kind of anti-democratic deed&quot; or behaviour which sought to destabilize the democratic order.

1968 Wow, as soon as Bolsonaro returned to the country, it took Brazil authorities only a couple of weeks to interrogate him. 

Meanwhile, Trump is on camera sending a violent mob to storm the Congress, there's a recording of him asking Georgia state secretary to find him 11.000 additional votes, as well as a detailed investigation conducted by the Jan 6th commitee that concluded Trumo tried to overturn democratic elections with lies and violence - and yet the US authorities didn't lift a finger against him for over two years now. 

At any rate, US justice system should take notes on how Brazil is handling this.

1972 The Marshall islands are effectively a protectorate of the US. They are a former US colony that has its defense completely handled by the US. There is a low, but non zero, change this leads to direct action by the US military as theoretically the US must defend the Marshall islands if attacked, and seizing a tanker registered in the Marshall islands could be consider as such.

This is why she is fired.

Russians bomb ukrainian cities unprovoked, especially targeting residential centers with precision munitions and abduct ukrainian children en-masse and deport them into Russia. They also remove all cultural symbols from any area they occupy. Textbook genocide. Case closed. This is why she is not just fired but on trial.

2017 What she said is awful, and tying Soros to it is anti-Semitism, but it is far worse that she's being tried for it. The whole point of Western values is democracy. It was good they fired her, but don't accuse her of a crime.

Soros was a victim of both Fascism and Communism. Each side accuses him of supporting the other side, but he has always been consistently for democracy and openness. But now those old ideologies have disappeared and extreme left and right have become friends, after all those bloody wars. Now it is dictatorship against democracy. Whether you know it or not, the battle lines have been drawn.

We banned Russia Today in the EU, and Fox News should maybe be banned too. They have no belief in democracy. They hate it and have no right to use it as a tool to destroy it. But punishing people with jail is a different matter.

2019 Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure that goes without saying.

Kim knows this. The guy studied at elite western schools as a child. He is aware he can‚Äôt go directly at the west.

Edit: Since a few people seem to be confused about the relevance of him studying in the west, the point is that he didn‚Äôt grow up only knowing North Korea. He spent a significant portion of his life outside the country and was educated by top schools. He is not *that* delusional about fighting a war with NATO countries.

> David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee and former British foreign secretary, said the international community was in danger of neglecting the wider crisis in Sudan in the rush to evacuate foreign nationals.

> The fighting broke out on 15 April as the result of a bitter power struggle between the regular army and RSF. Army commander Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF chief Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, disagree about the country&#039;s proposed move to civilian rule, and in particular about the timeframe of the 100,000 strong RSF&#039;s inclusion into the army.

2131 Translation: Shape up or get ready to ship out. Despite what plenty of people here routinely claim, the lack of a specific provision to remove NATO members doesn't mean that it's impossible. Rather there is an existing bit of international law which covers treaty members in material breach of their obligations, which Hungary certainly is. Personally I hope that we ship Hungary out, there's no upside to maintaining this facade with dictator-for-life Orban and his cronies.

2190 Even if it just exaggerated rumors, when you are an authoritarian strongman you can't really afford to look weak.

Voters will  hear about those rumors and no amount of telling the public that it is all lies will help when they are used to you lying to them.

It will also make it harder to keep allies on your side.

It is one thing to help a dictator to rig a vote or prevent a peaceful transfer or power when you think they will be around to reward you for it. It is another thing to take a gamble on someone who might not be around much longer.

And then there are the people who would like to be his successors. Rumors of a health scare will have hopefuls staking out positions and see who would support who if it came to it. Once those calculations are advanced enough they might not care all that much about small details like the guy in charge technically not being ill at all.

2313 Mexico‚Äôs current sitting government has been compromised and infiltrated. The current government is being controlled by the cartels and any action the US takes against the cartels is met with retaliation from the Mexican government. In other words it‚Äôs essentially a Mexican Taliban situation with the only thing left to do for the cartel is to officially raid the government buildings and take over the country in a coup.

2375 Duh! Did it really take them over a year to realize this would happen?

As soon as the conscriptions started, I wondered if this was a sick method of thinning out the population. Add to this the thousands that left the country, and the workforce was bound to tank.

"Where am I trespassing even?"
That one had them stumped because all they could say was "oh man" and I finally got tired of them talking at me like I'm trash so I asked who they represent.

"Iran." They replied

2385 Finnish PM-designate to form coalition with far right 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
2386 Finn here. 

No. This is like a third time this month. They're not forming a coalition with ' far right'. If The Finn's party is 'far right' then we need another word for actual far right, as they're probably more center than GOP. And this is coming from a leftist, I have no dog in the race or need to make them sound better than they are. But this is just factually incorrect.


For anyone who's interested, Orpo is forming a coalition of 4 parties. His own (center-right), the Finn's (right-wing; not 'far right'), Swedish-Speaking party and Christian party. The former two are so minor they're just happy to sit on the table.

2419 __Switzerland is bolstering its fight against terrorism and violent extremism with the use of cyber agents that operate under false identities on the internet.__

By the end of the year, the Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) plans to use cyber agents that go under cover with false identities to collect intelligence-related data in social networks. This is part of an effort to ‚Äúadapt to the development of threats in the virtual world,‚Äù the Federal Intelligence Service told Swiss public television, SRF.

Swiss intelligence has already benefited from the use of cyber agents from foreign intelligence services in ‚Äúseveral cases‚Äù. It would now like to develop its own capabilities, independent of partner services.

‚ÄúThe FIS doesn‚Äôt give information on the number of virtual agents, nor on their capacities or their schedule,‚Äù  said FIS according to Keystone-SDA. From a legal perspective, undercover agents are regulated in the same way whether they are in the real or virtual world. The current law requires the Swiss defence minister, Viola Amherd, to approve each false identity.

The cyber agents will also be subject to the supervision of the supervisory bodies of the FIS, in particular the independent authority to monitor intelligence activities and a special parliamentary committee.

2605 Slippery fellow, that Lula. 

The election came down to former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Simone Tebet, and Ciro Gomes as alternatives to Bolsonaro. 

Also running as candidates were Trotskyite Vera Lucia Salgado, the ultraliberal multimillionaire Luiz Felipe d‚ÄôAvila, the populist Soraya Thronicke and the ever-present Christian Democracy candidate, Jos√© Maria Eymael, who has been in the race for every Brazilian presidential election since 1998.

Simone Nassar Tebet is a Brazilian academic, lawyer, and politician who has served as the Brazilian Minister of Planning since 1 January 2023. A member of the Federal Senate for Mato Grosso do Sul since 2015, she was previously mayor of Tr√™s Lagoas from 2005 to 2010. 

Ciro Ferreira Gomes GOMM, known mononymously as Ciro, is a Brazilian politician, lawyer, and academic. Ciro is currently affiliated with and vice-president of the Democratic Labour Party. Born in S√£o Paulo but raised in Cear√° into a political family, Ciro began his political career at the age of 27 in 1984.

2637 "The Netherlands, despite a reputation as a country that heroically resisted the Germans"

We have a reputation of heroically resisting Nazi Germany? I thought we surrendered fairly quick and that more than 25000 Dutch men fought in the Waffen SS. My grandpa and grandma had stories of German soldiers being nice to Dutch people but that this relation only changed when the Germans were getting their asses kicked and they needed more workers for their factories and more food to serve their war effort. The change happened during 1943 and this quite matches with German losses and strikes in the Netherlands. My grand grand father also went in hiding that year because he was a Non-NSB mayor and did not want to join the NSB. 

Also the railway service were assisting the Nazis in deporting jews to concentration camps and were happy to make money from it.

2658 I don't know why this is controversial, refugees don't always have the same values and culture as the place they are trying to go to. You want to make sure you only bring on the ones who share your values and won't overload your support systems in place. Opening the doors is how you turn one place into the place they were fleeing from.

2663 So do the Tories. Can we force them on a ship to Rwanda? 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
2664 I mean, inevitably some of them do.


Thats kind of why you should have a department to assess whether those people will fit well. Though I suspect the real point is that the tories feel its good policy to discourage foreigners from coming here. Particularly those who are "visibly" different. 


They might consider being a bit more creative with their methods as well. If they are religious, have them swear to tell the truth on their holly text / gods name. If the concern is that they are fanatics, it's going to be a tough sell for them to lie in their deity's name.


Easier for them to just suggest all of them just hate our way of life. Despite being desperate to come here? 


All of this is quite circumstantial anyway, they'd rather pay Rwanda millions to take these asylum seekers. Who will undoubtedly stay in Rwanda, and not immediately try to leave again... 140 million paid as of October, and they hadn't even sent anyone to Rwanda.


Uk tries to act tough on it, but their policies on the issue have been a failure from start to finish.

2671 Have a friend who was an immigrant from a 3rd world country and grew up in the slums, he hates illegal immigrants. Because he had to do things the fair and right way, he applied for the visa and all the paper work, paid for all of it as well and bought desired skills and embraced the language and culture.

His view was if your coming to a western culture it's extremely rude to not learn the language, to not integrate yourself into the way of life and culture of the place and to not pay your fair share. Like so many other immigrants have done things the right way it's pretty rude that people get to skip the line.

2705 Personally I think that the political arena of television and talk shows prevents a completely logical discussion from ever taking place as the figures simply try to create favorable sound bites and short video clips for campaign purposes. That being said, it WOULD be worth discussing the merits of her claim. Some people coming to Europe do not wish to assimilate into Western cultures, and they do not agree with Western morality or customs. I don‚Äôt think this is a central problem, but this difference in belief results in segregated communities who are at odds with the general public.

Now the criticize the UK. The UK has for nearly two centuries cultivated the idea that culture is the same as ‚Äúrace‚Äù and that values are genetically passed from generation to generation via their somewhat similar skin tone. This is complete and utter bullshit, yet it forms a bedrock of English identity and even caused the country to exit a clearly advantageous trade block. So the UK‚Äôs racism keeps them from creating a functioning immigration system in each assimilation to western values is encouraged. If you look at other countries like Germany, Portugal, and France (to some extent) they have policies and integration strategies that support a diverse ethnic group of Westerners with a nation flavor. The UK probably won‚Äôt get there.

> Bras&iacute;lia - Former Brazilian far-right president Jair Bolsonaro appeared before federal police on Wednesday to testify over anti-government riots by his supporters in January, a police source told AFP. Bolsonaro is being investigated for his alleged role in masterminding and instigating the riots that sought the overthrow of his successor, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

> Bolsonaro, who returned to Brazil in late March after spending three months in Florida, has always denied his involvement in the riots.

> Bolsonaro left Brazil for Florida on December 30, two days before he was due to hand over the presidential sash to Lula.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , post

2735 Here's a preview of the story: 

The ISIS leader responsible for the planning of the 2021 attack at the Kabul airport that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members has been killed by the Taliban, according to senior administration officials. 

The White House says it will not release the name of the man, but described him as the "mastermind" of the assault on Abbey Gate, one of the main points of entry for those trying to evacuate Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal. 

Officials learned of his death in Afghanistan weeks ago, but said it has taken some time to confirm.

"Experts in the government are at high confidence that this individual‚Ä¶was indeed the key individual responsible" for the attack outside Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26, 2021, a senior administration official told CBS News. More than 100 Afghan civilians were also killed in the suicide bombing.

> After U.S. Central Command concluded civilians were killed, top brass called it &quot;a terrible mistake&quot; but said they had relied on credible intelligence of an imminent threat at the airport.

> The devastating attack on the airport came as U.S. and other Western forces used the facility as a coordination and exit point for the chaotic withdrawal.

2789 "With tensions at a fever pitch, the Scandinavian neighbors found themselves on the precipice of an accidental war, fueled by pride, fear, and a bitter feud over proper lutefisk preparation. Diplomats scrambled to untangle the web of misunderstandings that had ensnared their countries. As the first shots were fired, the world held its breath, watching in horror as the icy north transformed into a crucible of bloodshed and vengeance." --*Frozen Fury*, Tom Clancy

2816 Sudan crisis: UK accused of delaying German evacuation efforts 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , post
2817 "British attempts to evacuate its embassy staff from Sudan at the weekend delayed efforts by other countries to rescue their own citizens, senior German political sources have told the BBC. (...) Germany, among others, had planned to use the airfield north of Khartoum from which subsequent evacuation operations have been conducted. But, the sources say, the "unannounced British military presence" so angered the Sudanese army that they refused access to the facility. (...)

And, in Berlin, there are lingering traces of disdain for the UK government's initial handling of the crisis.  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock may not have mentioned the UK by name but launched a thinly disguised attack on countries that, she implied, had abandoned their citizens and focused their rescue efforts only on diplomatic staff."

2943 Pardon me if I take the words of people allied with Rafael Correa with a grain of salt. 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
2944 The committee will have 10 days to prepare its report. The impeachment hearings are the first in decades. Opposition lawmakers - many allied with former President Rafael Correa, himself convicted of corruption - would need 92 of 137 legislators to favor removing Lasso if the process goes to the full chamber.

There is more than enough evidence that corruption at a public company was allowed by Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso, justifying his removal from office, an opposition lawmaker testified to congress on Wednesday. Opposition lawmakers have pushed impeachment hearings against the conservative former banker, alleging Lasso disregarded embezzlement connected to an oil shipping contract between public company Flopec and a private sector business.

"That's why he should be censured and removed, this is the constitutional truth and the political truth that many are trying to hide from the Ecuadorean people," said Veloz, who presented letters and video she said showed Lasso's guilt. "There is more than enough proof of acts of corruption at Flopec."

when it comes to nation states, everyone spies on everyone else to the best of their abilities. 

knowledge is power, and lacking knowledge, at best leaves you in a disadvantageous position, at worst it can leave you dead.

> It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

I had a lovely time there, and it was very clean, safe and organised. They didn't have a drug culture like in my home city/country.

A friend of mine who smokes weed every day wanted to travel there and I warned her not to even try to bring it on her. She asked if she could buy some weed there, I said probably not. She then decided that Singapore and Changi airport were just not for her. They take this issue very seriously! In my country, people fly between cities with stashes of weed on them and go through airport security. Nothing is confiscated - for domestic flights.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
3123 Many are against this because criminals will use them (10 year olds) to commit crimes. So the solution is to harshly punish the children for the actions of the criminal. A crime intervention strategy. Criminals could (and do) use 7 year olds in a similar manner so perhaps the age should be lower not higher. 

It‚Äôs interesting those working in detention centres in charge of children committing the highest levels of abuse  get away with their crimes because they convince the public of the children‚Äôs evilness.

Once in England, Bulger, therefore 10 year olds are evil monsters committing murder. High generalisability to Australian 10 year olds. It is easier to solve social issues by locking up children acting out. To prevent pedos we should lock up children, criminal intervention of the same ilk. Under this logic if 10 year olds have criminal responsibility so why can‚Äôt they also choose to have sex? Many countries are invoking this strategy to solve the pedo issue, lowering the age of consent.

While Americans are afraid of police and gun owners, Australians are afraid of 10 year olds. This not only reflects the general public‚Äôs understanding of such issues but the governments failures in social services and policies. I‚Äôll never forget the reformed child soldiers of Sierra Leone and the communities that embraced them. People who went through the most horrifying circumstances understood the difference between adults and Children, crimes and responsibility.

> Venezuela&#039;s best-known opposition leader, Juan Guaid&oacute;, has touched down in the United States after being unceremoniously ejected from Colombia while attempting to gatecrash a summit about the political future of his crisis-stricken homeland.

> Late on Monday, Guaid&oacute; announced he had crossed into Colombia on foot to escape Maduro&#039;s &quot;Persecution&quot; and attend an international summit which Colombia&#039;s president, Gustavo Petro, is hosting, in an effort to solve Venezuela&#039;s deeply entrenched political crisis.

> &quot;It&#039;s a sort of sad coda to his so-called presidency,&quot; said Sabatini, who said he suspected Guaid&oacute;&#039;s decision to travel to Colombia was a political stunt designed to reassert his waning authority over Venezuela&#039;s opposition.

 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
3191 Can someone explain what is wrong with considering nationality as a one (perhaps small) part of an overall risk assessment? Suppose you have to choose between two people, Person A and Person B, to award a visa. They seem equal in all respects re: risk except Person B is from a nation/territory with a higher rate of violence and crime than Person A. Why would it be inappropriate to take this information into account? After all, it‚Äôs just doing statistics. A random sample from population B will have a higher likelihood of violence and crime than a random sample from A, right? Seems totally fine for a country to use this information to determine risk of visa applicants. 

Of course, there are some ethical issues. You don‚Äôt want to weigh nationality too highly. Plausibly, many other factors are far more important. Second, you‚Äôd want to consider countervailing evidence. Third, you‚Äôll need to do some fairly technical stats and modeling to make sure you‚Äôre actually gathering and analyzing the relevant data correctly. But provided that those conditions are met, I see no problem at all with nationality being included as but one data point in an overall, holistic risk assessment. Reading this article left me with the sense that this is all that is being done. I didn‚Äôt get a clear sense that anything more obviously problematic was going on, such as completely banning people from certain nations/territories or something like that. 
 Other Countries' Political Relations , comment
3192 Nationality itself is not a risk factor, but, realistically, a perfect background check isn't possible, so, correlations should be taken into account to protect citizens from potential risks. Calling this "ethnic profiling" is hysterical. In a similar way, a nation's stats for homicide rates can be taken into account and "ethnically profile" by the implied definition of this article.

the north atlantic treaty to which he probably is referring when he uses "de jure", article 8 of said treaty states:

3380 Tough matter. I am generally in favour of conscription in peaxe time, as it prepares the army for its main purpose to defend the own country. So people who are willing to fight in case of a have the capabilities to do so.

The issue with force conscription in wartime is: can you force a guy to fight for a country he doesn't care that much? If he says, he prefers to be governed by another country than to risk his life. Who can blame him? And on what basics.

‚ÄúAs you know, in April the Cabinet of Ministers expanded the powers of the TCC and SP, from now on summonses can be served regardless of registration and place of residence on military records.

Under what conditions the summons is considered served and in what case it can be signed by relatives of the conscript

Lawyer Maksym Shinzyrbaev explained whether a summons is considered served if it is signed by a relative of a conscript.‚Äù

3514 Nice, but remember that "international law" is a PR tool created for the poor and uneducated. Often used by both sides of a conflict. International law was first and exhaustive described by Machiavelli in his **"Il Principe"**. Every treaty has a clause that each party can terminate it at any moment without justification quoted. The very idea to privilege the strong in the Security Council originate in this: without it, all permanent members would have terminated their UN membership long ago.

If the defending country doesn't conscript while the invaders do, you are still going to have to fight eventually. Because empires dont stop invading. The question is what do you want to fight for when running is no longer an option?

3679 Killing person (civilian or military) who want to surrender is war crime according [international humanitarian law](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/israel-law-review/article/rule-of-surrender-in-international-humanitarian-law/714B1EAB954811EB2907A046EA069504).

3826 There are two kinds of Genocide, Assimilation and ethnic cleasning. Assimiation is preferable to ethnic genocide as it allows people to live and be treated as equals. The Colonial European powers were mostly never interested from genocide as they always segregated themselves from the others. As a result they kept all the prosperity to themselves at the expense of their subjects. It wasn't until the era of WW2 that geniune liberal efforts to have cultures coexist begin.

3923 Hello. I am from Ukraine. I am sure that you know about the situation in my country and about things happening right now. Many people are giving infinitely valuable help to Ukrainian refugees, donating to UAF and simply helping spread the truth. Ukraine, Ukrainians, and personally I appreciate their help highly. Thank them so heartily.

But now I am here to ask you, the Reddit community, for help. There is no safe place in Ukraine right now ‚Äî everywhere you might get killed by a missile strike, so holding the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) selections is obviously impossible. Our dear friends from Poland decided to help us. They will organise everything for us, but they need money.

[‚Üí Click here to donate ‚Üê](https://zrzutka.pl/en/v7pdbm)

Ukrainian competitive programmers are one of the most powerful cp-eps in the World. Our the most recent achievements:

* Baltic Olympiad in Informatics ‚Äî 4 gold medals, 2 bronze medals
* International Zhautyk Olympiad ‚Äî 2 gold medals, 3 silver medals, 7 bronze medals
* Romanian Masters of Informatics ‚Äî 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal, 6 bronze medals
* International Autumn Tournament in Informatics ‚Äî 2 gold medals, 3 silver medals, 3 bronze medals
* European Girls Olympiad in Informatics ‚Äî 1 gold medal, 3 silver medals
* European Junior Olympiad in Informatics ‚Äî 4 silver medals, 4 bronze medals
* International Olympiad in Informatics ‚Äî 1 gold medal, 2 silver medals
* All-Russian Team Olympiad among Scholars ‚Äî 1st absolute place, it was the first time when Ukraine team become the winner of this competition and one of a few times that has received a medal.

and so on...

Participation in the IOI is the most wanted dream for every competitive programmer in school times and Russia is trying to break this dream for each of us. But you can help. Everything is in your hands. If everyone, who reads this post, donates about 1 euro, the fundraising will end in 24 hours.

We need your help. Thanks in advance.

1) razomforukraine.org   Razom means together in ukrainian. They have warehouses all over the US shipping to three large Ukrainian cities. I now get an email from them every few weeks outlining the progress being made. Early on it was food, clean water, coats, shoes, diapers, etc. As the fighting got worse they‚Äôve been focusing on field medicine kits, with instructions how to treat a variety of battle trauma injuries, and surgical supplies to hospitals, as well as needed supplies to treat the civilians who are being targeted.

2)  eurogroupforanimals.org/news/how-you-can-support-animal protection-organisations-ukraine   This panEuropean organizations are fighting on many fronts for the welfare of animals, but are now actively supporting Ukraine‚Äôs efforts to feed, water, provide veterinary care, often treating animals with a wide variety of trauma, as Russians have been torturing animals lured in by the offer of food. We‚Äôve all since the very heartening response of Ukraine‚Äôs military caring for some of these animals. But they‚Äôve got war to fight and it‚Äôs up to civilians to provide care. Eurogroup for animals has the resources and training to help, and they know where money is best spent.

3974 Indeed they have, however, once the conflict is over, there are other methods to help support Ukraine available that will probably off set any tariff by 10-100 fold. Everything from rebuilding the infrastructure to assistance with shipping and handling of products will help them keep things going. Plus as the situation changes, it can be adapted.  A year is a long time, plenty of time to adjust as needed. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
3975 But the EU was never a customer of Ukraine for grain. That's where the problem has arisen. To protect EU farmers they placed a ridiculous tariff on Ukrainian grain in the more normal times. And this didn't cause a problem because Ukraine had access to all the ports and all the ships so they sold it else where for a decent price. Problem arose when that access was cut and they started having to ship it to Poland amongst other places. Some rather unscrupulous grain merchants were meant to be shipping it onwards but instead began scalping the cargos rather than organising their transport further along the line. So when it come to grain should return to business as usual . Minus hitting the mines

Its an utter joke of a plan and just gives Russia everything they want while screwing Ukraine.

Biden is getting ready to ditch Zelensky - there's already been a couple of articles floated in the media to prep people.

And Ukraine is never, in any universe, joining NATO since they are involved in a territorial dispute with Russia and would therefore have to ask Russia's permission by conceding a peace deal.

But to make out anyone in the West who wants tax payers money spent at home i stead of Ukraine is pro-Russian is such bullshit.

Theres many arguments for not supporting Ukraine. I don't agree with them, but many have nothing to do with being pro-Russian.

If it was Angola being invaded by Russia I might share Tuckers arguments. The US blows a lot of money on other countries whilst not spending on its own. Nothing crazy about that view.

But Ukraine deserves western money and support. We must beat back Russia.

4069 New song for Ukraine 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
4070 Yes, but not for the reason you think. "PMCs" for powerful state entities are springing up all over Russia, but fighting in Ukraine is the last thing on their mind, except as a tiny token of symbolism to pretend "we're doing our bit, too."

The real reason is Russia is preparing for internal chaos following a likely extreme instability (possibly even a civil war) in Russia once their invasion is lost, and these PMCs are nothing but extrajudicial state-backed mafias to keep control over financial assets once law and order completely collapses in Russia. Essentially, a return of the 1990s-style "Russian mafia" rule, except the people in power want to be a step ahead, and install their own mobsters first, to ensure they keep the lucrative petroleum assets.

4137 If there were any justice in this world, what Moscow has done to Ukraine would be done to Russia, ten times over.

However, there is no divine justice, no karma. There is only what we can contrive as human beings.  And few of us have the stomach to give Moscow what it deserves.

Please hang in there, Ukraine. You have exceeded all expectations. It is hard to do, but keep fighting, victory will be yours. Maybe you don't turn Moscow into Bakhmut, but if you can remove the invaders, that's all you need to do. They are withering.

4154 This is exactly where to do it provided they have a credible means across and to cross.  The russians are at the very end of a long supply tether, if they can get across and cause the local russian units to rout like they did after the Karkiv counteroffensive last fall, they can push down to or through the Crimean neck sealing it off, and then everything faces east.

4160 Speaking as someone with 15 years military experience. Do not do this. Join the British military. They are one of the only militaries we honestly view as equal to ours in the US. They are absolutely top notch professionals. They will turn you into an expert in whatever field you end up working, and they will invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into your training. They will pay you and provide you with everything you need, including long term medical care which you will need after military service. Can the same be said for the Ukrainian volunteers? 

NATO is moving heaven and earth for Ukraine and you‚Äôd more than likely have a direct impact on the war without putting yourself in the position where you are an untrained, low value grunt no one is going to have a vested interest in.

You owe it to yourself, your family and your future children to use the opportunities you have  to excel and thrive in everything you do. Trying to chase the image of the battle hardened door kickers isn‚Äôt worth it. Watch the videos of the kids getting grenades dropped on them from drones while they are sleeping. That‚Äôs happening to both sides. 

Real military power is in air power, and large manned weapons platforms; systems dropping large amounts of ordnance on the enemy. Not the guy with a $50 AK crawling in frozen mud 200m from the enemy who wants to torture and castrate you if you manage to survive. Go learn how to fix helicopter then work on a little education and fly them. Or find something that suits your interest that you could do for 10 or 20 years. I have friends who joined enlisted who are now pilots, Intel officers, K-9 officers, Special investigators, doctors. You name it, put in the time and go to school and great opportunities will open up for you.

Please do something better than wander into Donbas with no clue of what‚Äôs what with no ability to read or speak the language.

4163 I joined in late February 2022 at 19 when the invasion began, I mean this in the most respectful way but you will be a liability to the squad and I see no reason why they would accept you anymore. You *will* get yourself killed.

It's not like last year, they're solely looking for experienced soldiers now. 
Too many people were fucking around and trying to be war tourists.

Also I want to give you an insight. It's a shitshow over there, I was stationed in Yavoriv and lost a lot of comrades even whilst being so far west in the country. 
It's not something that's easy to live down.

It's truly traumatising and there's much better ways you can help the country. 
If you want to help the state you can start by helping the people, if you want to actually do something rather than just donate, volunteer at a refuge, whether it be in your own country or in mainland Europe. I done both of these roles and I must say it was more fulfilling helping refugees.

Good luck.

4164 Dude don't do that. Without proper training you aren't really useful for combat. And you are 18. No need to die in Ukraine. Honestly mate put you hand up for humanitarian work. You can make more of a difference doing that than a inexperienced soldier who does not speak the language.

4165 At the moment, this war is off-limits to anyone without military experience. I agree with everyone who has said this so far.

You really don‚Äôt want to be on the receiving end of what is going on there right now. Get skilled up, get experience. Join the uk armed forces of you really like the idea.

Remember, fighting Russians is not the only way to be of help to the wonderful people of Ukraine.
There will be need of a shedload of rebuilding, demining and getting the country back on its feet after Russia has been defeated.

The final defeat will not be on any battlefield, but when peace has been restored, and Ukraine is powering ahead in the modern world, leaving a destitute Russia to navel gaze and wonder where the hell they went wrong. 

Objective : Prosperity

4167 Ukraine has plenty of manpower. Ukraine needs weapons, drones, ammo, equipment of all sorts, supplies, vehicles, everything. Ukraine doesn't need battlefield liabilities that will get much more effective people killed. And you see foreign volunteer guys clearing trenches, and they often need translators just to talk to each other. Ammo expenditure is extremely high. For example, the amount of grenades they need to use to clear out the rat holes and bunkers in the trenches is insane. Send money, write letters to politicians, and share on social media. It all helps win the war. Can't stay in the fight if you're dead. The fight is at home, too. It's a legitimate front of the war, just getting Ukraine what it needs to do the work. 1 soldier shooting and bombing invaders needs who even knows how many people supporting them, it could be thousands or tens of thousands of people's support that gets that soldier what they need. Be in that fight.

4168 The Ukrainians won‚Äôt let you fight. They already tried to just letting anyone in Foreign legion.  But they changed that after like 2-3 months because they found out that most soldiers had no experience, and would run away or worse.

4170 They will not except you, when the shit first hit the fan many thousands flocked to sign up, many blagged there way in, in the first month after getting there basic training in Ukraine 80% of these foriegn recruits were not helpfull they were causing more problems, they had no combat experience and no Military disapline, they were all sent back to where they come from.
Now all foreign recruits are vetted before even getting a pair of boots.
There was many foriegn recruits who had combat experience and been in several theatres of war but after a few months in Ukraine they returned to there homes this even included ex British soldiers, why did they leave you ask? Well they had been in theatres where they had western weapons air support, in Ukraine you could be in a trench under artillery fire for 24hrs with nothing to do but hide, it is intense, you cant just call for air support to shut them guns ups.
If want to do some thing join the British Army get trained and be there in the future for your country or even to help other nations in need.
You would not last a week on the front lines and nobody has time to wet nurse you, you may cause the loss of your fellow teams lifes through not knowing simple things.
Its not as simple as picking a gun up and firing it.
Do you even know the basics of survival ? How to take care of your own basic health living in those conditions.

4195 What's described here sounds a lot like probing attacks across a wide front.

This is typically used to identify weak points in the line and identify and pin the Russian units in position.
If deemed successful, the main force can be directed to the weak points, to try and achieve a breakthrough

Alternatively this could be just a holding attack, with the intent to draw in Russian reinforcements, and pin them in place, thereby making the area selected for the main attack weaker. If we recall the Kharkiv offensive, it was preceded by what looked like a build up around Kherson, drawing in much of the available Russian combat power to that area, far from the real main thrust.  

The Russians are less likely to commit troops based on a supposed build up, given how they were fooled last time, so a holding attack makes sense to get the Russians to commit their reserve.  But it also makes sense if the Russians don't commit reserves to this area to turn this into the main thrust.  Particularly as this area it of strategic importance to Ukraine's goal of retaking Crimea.  Seizing the Azov coast would limit resupply of Crimea to the Kerch bridge and ferries.   While bridges are very difficult to take out, the approaches are choke points and possibly vulnerable to interdiction from the air or long range missiles.

4210 When Russia Invaded Ukraine in February 2022 Ukraine‚Äôs military was only a [few years](https://www.fpri.org/article/2018/08/the-ukrainian-military-from-degradation-to-renewal/) out of a complete reorganization. Many analysts focus on the [training, advice, and support](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-military-success-years-of-nato-training-11649861339) it had received on offensive and defensive operations, its professional military education reforms, or its emphasis on employing new Western weapons like Javelins. And yet it is often the seemingly more peripheral factors that limit‚Äîor enhance‚Äîa military‚Äôs battlefield prospects. Military leaders from Frederick the Great to Napoleon knew more than two centuries ago that [an army marches on its stomach](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/15/army/), and yet most observers paid scant attention to this element of Ukraine‚Äôs defense. Even with the best weapons, the best training, and the best leadership, an armed force can only fight as long as it is fed. One person who has lived that truism every day in Ukraine for the past fourteen months is Chef Zhenya Mykhailenko.

4235 It's an interesting read. Of course, all governments and societies deal with similar aspects of corruption. What makes this situation unique is the war. The article well outlines that when the war is over, there could be a reckoning, and not just about Zelensky or possibly corruption.

I also understand why the person inside the Ukraine government was careful as to not say anything that the Russian propaganda machine could get ahold of. It's absolutely necessary to preserve unity and prevent attempts to undermine it. 

However, an unintended consequence has been that any notion or opinion that isn't glowing of Ukraine and its government/politics and its various factions is immediately greeted as Russian disinformation or propaganda. I hate to say this, but I'm subject to more anger and accusations in the pro Ukraine subs than in the neutral (mostly pro Russian) subs on the rare occasions I get dragged into an exchange with someone. 

It's annoying, but necessary. I too agree that much of it will simply have to wait until after the war, and there could very well be consequences for that but the consequences of Russia fracturing unity for Ukraine and its partners is worse. It's not a knock on Ukraine, it's a knock on the human condition when exposed to absolute power and greed in any conditions, let alone war time.

4242 We have this problem in Slovakia too.

Grain from Ukraine that was supposed to be reexported to other countries, as our help to Ukraine, when Russia blocked naval export, was bought by local companies/mills, and sold locally.

Further, some was bought by mills in other countried (Poland was mentiones) and imported as EU product.

That means, our local farmers have problem selling their grain, and I guess someone in the world misses it.

I'm all for support of Ukraine, but that grain should've been gone for long.

4285 It's a great point that there's not enough additional Leopard 2's that can be spared, but tons of Abrams. There are thousands just sitting in storage doing nothing.

I think Ukraine will show that they can make good use of the Abrams and the U.S. would send more. They just have to refurbish old stocks and upgrade them, or alternately make brand new tanks. Poland has a factory around being built now to maintain them, which Ukraine could use. 

The 2024 Spring Offensive should be 2x the scale of this upcoming Spring Offensive. Need a ton of weapons for it.

4293 How ready is Ukraine for a spring offensive? 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
4294 russia will get over losing, they know how to accept defeat and have done so a lot over the last few decades, they rely on their enemy believing there lies and propaganda and horrendous crimes against civilians to spread fear and confusion which they are masters at doing, although not so much in Ukriane as Ukrainians are the strongest willed people they have ever faced. 

Their  military really is not that good, they rely almost solely on artillery and missile and sending in large numbers of cannon fodder or meat as they call themselves, they are under trained and  not equipped to win. The only reason they captured the land they did in Ukraine was years of planning and sending in hoards to push the enemy back but also infiltrating the powers that be in the areas they won.

And forget the nuke threat, one nukes no matter how small and NATO gets hands on in not only removing them from Ukriane but from almost every area of interest in the world.

Russia has already lost this war, pootin is  just doing his all to ensure it lasts as long as possible, he in his arrogance has just not accepted he has lost yet as when russia pulls out of Ukraine he fears he will lose his head. 

pootin needs an out and will create a situation to put the blame on someone else, maybe throwing the next election letting someone else take the blame for retreating out of Ukriane and then coming back claiming russia was winning and could have defeated Ukraine with just a little more time. Blaming everyone else for russias defeat but himself and retaking power, by force if necessary. The russian people are really that stupid to believe him and support him even after russians find out the massive losses and damage done to russias military.

Just think while you sit reading this about how Ukriane initially with almost no help from the west managed to not only hold russia back in most areas but also pushed them out of a heck of a lot of land they had won. 

Little tiny Ukraine's military did this against the supposed 2nd  best and most feared military forces. Just think about how it would be seen if say Mexico was invaded by America and They managed to not only hold America at a virtual stalemate when America was pushing forward over a year or more, but managed to push America out of great swaths of land they had won in the initial invasion, and yes it is an apt comparison.

&#x200B;

I feel very confident in the Ukriane offensive or offensives coming soon, with serious upgrades to equipment even if not in the numbers they want and with the superior planning seen in the last offensives russia just cannot win.

4296 How hard would it be to intercept their channel and tell those soldiers to revolt and take out their command? Inviting them to surrender en masse and give them options for their future?

Maybe even get a native rus speaker to make it sound like it was coming from their side. I feel like Ukraine could use a boost on their psyops and propaganda front. 

US and Germans  use to drop leaflets on battlefields during ww2 with messages to weaken the resolve of enemy troops. It definitely messed with morale. I feel like a lot of rus soldiers are close to that breaking point, and that could be capitalized on.

4300 When Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, it quickly became apparent that one of their primary objectives was the capital of Kyiv. Over the next five weeks, they attempted to penetrate the city to overthrow the democratically elected government. By April 2, when [Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Defense announced](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3446926-kyiv-region-liberated-from-russian-invaders-defense-ministry.html) that not only was the city itself secure but all areas in the entire Kyiv region that had been seized had been recaptured by Ukrainian forces, the outcome of the Battle of Kyiv was clear. Russia had failed. Defying widespread expectations that Russia‚Äôs military advantages would weigh in its favor, Ukrainian forces and Kyiv‚Äôs civilian population successfully defended the city and defeated what was believed to be the second most powerful military in the world.

Last month, John Spencer visited Ukraine and was invited to give a lecture that describes the major events that defined the Battle of Kyiv, as well as the key turning points and lessons that can be learned from the battle. The lecture was recorded by the *Kyiv Independent* and is presented in full in this episode of the *Urban Warfare Project Podcast*.

4311 what did these leaks even have. the right wing us is saying some wild things. ah I found it. its not so bad  

Several purported US intelligence assessments paint a more pessimistic outlook for the Ukrainian military than the US has provided publicly. They suggest Kyiv is heading for only ‚Äúmodest territorial gains‚Äù in its [much-anticipated spring counteroffensive](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/23/russian-forces-lose-steam-as-ukraine-prepares-counteroffensive).

The documents also indicate Ukraine is using up large amounts of air defence stocks, including Russian-made BUK and S-300 systems, leaving the country vulnerable to attacks from Russian military aircraft.

4312 I strongly believe these were leaked intentionally. Churchill once said In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.

You give the enemy little bits of gold (that aren't that damaging) the South Korea thing, the spying on Zelensky) none of what was leaked was that damaging. To hide the lie which is that Ukraine is running out of ammo and air defense. 

I bet that's why Biden travelled to Kyiv in person.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4334 Ah, it's that time again to talk about nazism. Below is all you need to know about this particular subject. 

Let's start with why we hate nazis. It's not because of their symbols on their tanks, their love of scary uniforms, or their stupid salte. It's because they kicked off a murderous campaign across Europe that would kill millions and did their best to exterminate those who didn't fit their criteria of Aryan. The methods used in those acts were as barbaric as one can imagine.

We don't abhor nazis for the superficial or the name itself. It's for the things they did. They could have called themselves anything, and it would be just as hated on account of what was done in its name.

Ukraine isn't a nazi country. Not in ideology, symbolism, or otherwise. This is known. However, after the invasion in 2014, some militias within Ukraine mounted a defense of their country along with the regular armed forces. Some of those militias do love them a bit of neonazi symbolism and maybe even ideology, especially and specifically towards Russia. Those elements have been absorbed into the armed forces of Ukraine out of necessity to defend against Russia.

To those claiming these are movie prop tanks or out of storage with previous markings, please do some research. Dont run from it. Get to the bottom of it. There are definitely some militias with an affinity for some neo nazism, even though many times the symbols are altered some. These elements may very well be a problem after the war, but there are more pressing concerns at this time, such as survival.

Let's say hypothetically that the US was invaded by a larger and superior force (impossible, I know). There would be no shortage of armed militias getting in on the homeland defense if it came to it. Some of those militias would be less than savory characters. The US military could fight them along with the invading force, but that's not practical. 

My point is that many countries, especially Russia, have neo nazi elements within their militaries and societies even. Russia is seeking to make it out like Ukraine itself is a nazi leaning country, and that's not true at all. However, these militias' love of nazi symbols have given Russia something to exploit, although any discerning person knows it's false and for propaganda purposes. 

Alot of words, but words of reason. Like the nazis, Russia will be remembered in a similar manner for attempting the same thing as the REAL Nazis did so long ago.

4364  ‚ÄòMy country has fallen out of time‚Äô: Russian author Mikhail Shishkin‚Äôs letter to an unknown Ukrainian

 My dearest one,

They stole the language from us. We spoke and corresponded with you in the language of great Russian literature. Now, for the whole world, Russian is the language of those who bomb Ukrainian cities and kill children, the language of war criminals, the language of murderers. They will be tried for crimes against humanity. I would like to believe that all those who prepared and participated in this war, who supported it in one way or another, will be put in the dock. But how can one go to trial for a crime against language?

My father went to the front when he was 17 to avenge his brother who was killed by the Germans. After the war, he hated Germans and everything German all his life. I tried to explain to him: ‚ÄúBut Dad, there is great German literature! German is a beautiful language!‚Äù These words had no effect on him. What will we be able to say after the war to the Ukrainians whose homes were bombed and looted by the Russians, whose families were killed? That the great Russian literature is beautiful? And that the Russian language is so wonderful?

Do dictators and dictatorships breed slave populations or do slave populations breed dictators? [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine) was able to escape from this hellish circle, to escape from our common, monstrous, bloody past. For this reason it is hated by Russian impostors. A free and democratic Ukraine can serve as an example for the Russian population, which is why it is so important for Putin to destroy you.

 

In Russia, we had neither de-Stalinisation, nor the Nuremberg trials of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. The result we see: a new dictatorship. A dictatorship, by its very nature, cannot exist without enemies, which means war.

The plans of the general staff included the refusal of Nato to defend you with its armed forces, and Nato fulfilled this plan of Putin in the first days of the war. You Ukrainians did not agree to Putin‚Äôs plans. You did not surrender, you did not greet his tanks with flowers. You are not only defending your freedom and human dignity; now you are defending the freedom and human dignity of all humanity. You cannot be defeated because the war is not decided by the number of tanks and missiles, but by the power of love for freedom. You are free men, and those who carry out the criminal orders of the Russian generals are slaves.

 

A year ago, when Russian tanks were already marching toward Kyiv, the whole world wondered why there were no mass anti-war protests in Russia, why only loners took to the streets. I attributed it to fear. Silence is a Russian survival strategy. Those who protested back then were in jail. This is how Russians have survived by silence for generations. Pushkin formulated this Russian way of life in the last line of his historical drama *Boris Godunov*: ‚ÄúThe people are silent.‚Äù And with the beginning of the aggression against Ukraine, the people were ‚Äúkeeping silent‚Äù. But then mass mobilisation began in the autumn, and it is no longer possible to explain away the fact that hundreds of thousands of Russians obediently went to kill Ukrainians and be killed. This is something else, something deeper, something scarier.

I see only one explanation: my country has fallen out of time. In the 21st century, the modern man himself is responsible for deciding what is good and what is evil. And if he sees that his country and his people are waging a despicable shameful war, he will be against his country and against his people. But most Russians mentally live in the past, when people associated themselves with their tribe. Our tribe is always right, and the other tribes are our enemies and want to destroy us. We are not responsible, we don‚Äôt decide anything, the chief/khan/king decides everything for us. This is how they think: if our enemies, the fascists from Ukraine and Nato, attack our homeland, we go to defend it, just as our grandfathers defended it from the German fascists. The feeling of love for the homeland, the beautiful sense of patriotism, was used by all dictators for their own purposes. My father thought he was defending his homeland from Hitler‚Äôs regime, but he was defending the same fascist regime of Stalin. Russians are now going to war, as Putin‚Äôs propaganda explained to them, to defend their homeland against ‚ÄúEuropean and American nazism‚Äù, and they don‚Äôt realise that they are protecting the power of a criminal gang in the Kremlin, which has taken the entire country hostage.

The only way out is to inflict a military defeat on the Putin regime. Therefore, democratic countries must help the Ukrainians with everything they can, and above all with weapons. After the war, the whole world will come to your aid to reconstruct what has been destroyed, and the country will be able to rebuild itself. And Russia will lie in the ruins of economy and in the ruins of consciousness. A new birth of my country is possible only through the complete destruction of the Putin regime. The empire must be amputated from the Russian person, like a malignant cancer. This ‚Äúhour zero‚Äù is vital for Russia. My country will have a future only if it passes through total defeat, as happened with Germany.

## Glory to Ukraine!

They will be defeated and suffer humiliation in Ukraine. 

Their regime will fall, its leaders imprisoned, the country and its population will face internal reckoning for their misdeeds, they will pay reparations to Ukraine and its people for the crimes it committed and they will need rebuilding from the ground up before they can begin to be a responsible nation on the world stage.

Dmitry Medvedev text on twitter at 12:50 pm ¬∑ 8 Apr 2023

this is not my views, hate them, think its important that people read all the tweet and also respond to tweeter accordingly

WHY WILL UKRAINE DISAPPEAR? BECAUSE NOBODY NEEDS IT

Europe doesn‚Äôt need Ukraine. The forced support of the Nazi regime, by the American mentor‚Äôs order, has put Europeans into a financial and political inferno. All for the sake of bandera‚Äôs unterukraine, that even the snobby, insolent Polacks don‚Äôt take for a valid country, and time and again toss in the issue of its western areas anschluss. There‚Äôs a nice perspective ahead: to permanently put the nouveau-Ukrainian blood-sucking parasites on the decrepit EU‚Äôs arthritis-crippled neck. That‚Äôll be the final fall of Europe, once majestic, but robbed off by degeneration.

The US doesn‚Äôt need Ukraine. True, the military and sanction campaigns are attempted for PR by political blabbermouths, who long ago attested to their impotence and imbecility. Average Americans don‚Äôt understand what ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù is, and where ‚Äúit‚Äù is. Most of them won‚Äôt show this ‚Äúpower‚Äù on the map on the first take. Why won‚Äôt the US establishment focus on inflation and job issues, or emergencies in their home States, instead of a country 404, unbeknownst to them? Why does so much dough go across the ocean?

Sooner or later, they‚Äôll ask for that. Then, storming of the Capitol in January 2021 would seem like scout games.

3. Africa and Latin America don‚Äôt need Ukraine. The hundreds of millions spent by US on pointless fights in Ukraine, could finance many development programmes for Latin American and African states.

Latin America is gringos‚Äô backyard ‚Äì that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been rubbing in for decades. Africa‚Äôs had its share of suffering from the genocide, and colonial dependence, imposed by former western slave traders. That‚Äôs why the people of African huts and Latin American favelas ask a very reasonable question: for their former suffering and present-day loyalty, why is somebody else rewarded ‚Äì very, very far away?

4. Asia doesn‚Äôt need Ukraine. By Russia‚Äôs example, they see ‚Äúcolour‚Äù technologies at work to eradicate the largest competing powers. They understand what scenario the America-led collective West has for them if they disobey. ‚ÄúHelp us to overcome Russia, and we‚Äôll soon come to you‚Äù, the utterly brazen Western leaders tell them. Such gigantic countries as India, China, and other Asia-Pacific states face the big enough challenge of post-pandemic economic recovery, let aside the drugged clowns, with their whining for aid.

‚ÄúWe are not interested in you‚Äù, Asia tells their messengers, responding to the calls to support Ukraine and confine Russia. The country, geopolitically many times closer to Asian powers, the one that historically has proven itself a reliable strategic partner. Do Asian giants need such headache coming from former colonisers?

5. Russia doesn‚Äôt need Ukraine. A threadbare quilt, torn, shaggy, and greasy. The new Malorossiya of 1991 is made up of the artificially cut territories, many of which are indigenously Russian, separated by accident in the 20th century. Millions of our compatriots live there, harassed for years by the Nazi Kiev regime. It is them who we defend in our special military operation, relentlessly eradicating the enemy. We don‚Äôt need unterukraine. We need Big Great Russia.

6. Finally, its own citizens don‚Äôt need the Nazi-headed Ukraine. That‚Äôs why out of 45 million people there‚Äôre only some 20 million remaining. That‚Äôs why those who stayed want to leave for any place: the hated Poland, EU, NATO, to be America‚Äôs 51nd state. Joining the Antarctic with its pinguins will also be fine. As long as it‚Äôs quiet, and the food‚Äôs good. The ruling junta‚Äôs criminal ambitions forced Ukrainians to beg and roam around the countries and continents, searching for a better life. All that is for an obscure European perspective. Or rather, to let the harlequin in a khaki tricot and his band of thievish Nazi clowns to put the money stolen from the West into their offshore accounts. Would ordinary Ukrainians need that?

Nobody on this planet needs such a Ukraine. That‚Äôs why it will disappear

4389 Why are we talking about ‚Äúpeace plans‚Äù? There will be no peace until Russia leaves Ukraine, anything less is just surrender so what‚Äôs the point of entertaining a random 3rd party‚Äôs opinion. Brazil is as far from Ukraine as you can get, not this dudes business. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4390 Russia undeniably had de facto control over Crimea at the start of 2022. If they'd settled for that then in all likelihood it would have at some point in the distant future, as generations passed, become de jure.

Finland no longer wants Karelia back as an example of how time changes things like this.

Ukraine wasn't trying to retake Crimea, Crimea was for all intents and purposes under unchallenged Russian control. So what does Lula think is different this time around? Because peace isn't Russia endlessly taking bites out of their neighbours, that's the opposite of peace.

Either Lula can't remember anything beyond 8 years or he's not really asking for peace. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4391 I can't help but think about how each one of those (or possibly pairs, triplets, etc.) have a unique designated high value target assigned to them. All of the intelligence work behind targeting and the grand strategy behind all of that. All of the intelligence networking through electronic systems happening in mere moments. The russians have capable weapons but I think this is something the russians just can't match. This level of coordination and information sharing is Ukraine's single best weapon next to their iron will for freedom, love of country and fellow Ukrainians. They have a long road ahead, but at current trajectory I have no doubts they will triumph!

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4451 The way I understand it is, we're now at a point where Ukraine has to take back Crimea.  But I think they can do it without actually invading Crimea.

If they can do a thunder run to the Sea of Azov and cut the Russian-held strip completely in half, they can capture the section of coastline between Mariopul and Melatopol.  From there they can launch surface to surface missiles on that big Crimean bridge...turning everything west of their position plus Crimea into the world's biggest prison camp. Russia won't be able to supply the tens of thousands of troops there. In terms of both number of troops and geographic area it'll be one of the largest encirclements of enemy troops ever done.

At that point they don't have to invade Crimea, they just have to hold the cut off and basically lay siege to it until Russia folds.

Now here's the kicker. Let's say Ukraine is okay with regaining all the territory lost in 2022 but leaving Russia with Crimea. That won't work. After Russia took over Crimea in 2014 Ukraine turned off the water supply coming into Crimea from the Ukrainian territory just north of Crimea. If Russia gets Crimea back Ukraine can do that again. Even if Ukraine agrees not to today, serious development in Crimea will be impossible because the water supply will be on shaky ground, health completely under the control of Ukraine.

Russia will never be able to maximize the development of Crimea until they also hold the territory just north of Crimea, and they can't hold that without holding the entire strip of land up to mother Russia itself as a resupply route. Crimea cannot be thought of as an independent piece of real estate because due to the natural geography, it's not and never was.

That's probably why Kruschev gave Crimea to the Ukrainian subdivision of the USSR back in the 1950s.

4494 Sending F-16 would be great - for the Russians. It's just not a good allocation of resources. Whoever thinks F-16 are just standing around waiting to be delivered to Ukraine in a moments notice but are held back by lack of political will is just uninformed.

Instead of funnelling all the military aid budget towards equipment that really helps Ukraine, like APC, AA, Tanks, PPE etc., billions of dollar would be spent on refitting the aircraft, building the infrastructure for them in Ukraine, setting up repair bases outside of Ukraine in NATO states, training pilots, training ground crew, setting up supply lines for maintenance... all that for a weapon platform that would not even make that much of an impact as the biggest threat for them are still ground based AA systems. F-16 are not stealthy. It would take years until Ukraine would receive the aircraft, instead of receiving higher volumes of more useful support in a shorter time.

I think few people know how fragile any modern jet fighter is and just how much stuff constantly breaks and how much energy, logistics, manpower and money is required to keep them operational.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4508 I know this has been discussed before, but I just can't understand the reasoning behind it other than sheer stupidity. But why is Russia trying so hard to capture Bakhmut? What is the strategic significance of this location? All the buildings seem to be obliterated and nearly every citizen appears to be evacuated. So why does Russia try so hard?

The only logical reason I've heard is that Russia has been building this fight up to its people as a major foothold in this war, and victory here would show people back home that they are winning. However I originally heard that was the plan for the anniversary of the start of the war, and that winning by that date was the goal. Obviously that didn't happen and now it's perhaps been moved to their victory day? But even so it seems like that's just what they say to compensate for making little to no progress in that area. 

Obviously Ukraine has been fighting there too, but unlike Russia they seem to be using it as a distraction or a way to stall the Russian military as they make progress in other areas. It may also serve a purpose in their counter offensive. And it's not like the Ukrainians are going anywhere, this is their home that they are defending, they can take their time if it means they can push the enemy away. It's much harder for the invaders to maintain a drawn out conflict when they have to ship their men and munitions out to the frontlines, which is why currently the situation concerning Crimea access is becoming a major issue for them. 

But I just can't fathom why Russia would sit in this city for so long when it's costing them so much and there's much better moves they could have attempted from a strategic perspective.

4527 It's really interesting how Ukraine focuses on winning while Putin focuses on looking like he's winning.

Russians are afraid of an Ukrainian counter-offensive, as Ukrainians might re-take land by piercing defensive positions of the Russian military.

4529 I don't get why the ruzzians are doing this. Not just from a "This is straight up evil genocide" angle, but from a strategic one as well. The terror bombings are just pissing off the Ukrainians and making them fight more. Why would they continue to use their finite resources on a tactic that isn't working? Why would they not just use the missiles and bombs to attack mustering grounds for Ukrainian forces? We know they are gathering their forces for a counter offensive, so why waste their missiles hitting residential buildings?

I get that this was a common strategy before and during WW2, but the allies carried out _extensive_ studies and learned that terror bombings were incredibly ineffective. That is why so much effort went into developing precision munitions. Are the ruzzians just truly stuck in a 40's mindset? Are most ruzzians just truly evil enough to do this, afterall, it isn't like it is high command flying the aircraft and launching the missiles? Is it vodka rot that makes them think it is a good idea?

If Zelenskyy himself proposes this peace formula, and the pope was even able to get Victor Orbann to listen, there is some sliver of hope. We must keep defending Ukraine because we know how the Kremlin strategy works, but as someone who lost a dear friend fighting for Ukraine already, we need to let the occupied people lead the way, not foist our government's interests on them. "Peace" on the invaders terms is bullshit, but a peace solution devised by the leadership of those brutalized by occupation and genocide is something we should all support

There's no more communism/fascism/democracy conflict. The world is in a war between dictatorship and democracy. Orb√°n and Erdogan have just chosen sides, carefully playing others against each other. We have to put up with Poland though. German towns in the 1930s raced to declare themselves "Judenfrei" as towns in Polish towns declare themselves "Gayfrei." But they're helping a lot for Ukraine and we need that. (They remember the 100-year occupation and Russia's invasion in 1920 and twice in WWII. Putin remembers with fondness. Make Russia Great Again.) DeSantis is doing the exact same thing. A psychopath wants moral purity. He's obviously read up on Hitler, as Saddam did on Stalin. And Putin talks all the time about morality. The Janjaweed have returned in Sudan. New name though. Anyone remember the genocide in Darfur? Wagner PMC is jumping at the chance for round two. Oh, and Xinjiang and Taiwan.

I'm not the pessimistic type. Pinker is dead right that the world has never been better off. (Please don't comment on that. I'll post something on that later. No one buys condemned criminals anymore to enjoy torturing them to death and entertain people. The Brits no longer hang 8-year-olds for stealing a handkerchief. Mass starvations aren't what they used to be, which maybe young folk don't remember.) It's just that the eternal dance of two steps forward and one step back has gotten an extra twist lately. If you're not scared, you're not paying attention.

His next attacks will be all those little satellite countries like Belarus, Latvia and Estonia, all uncomfortably close to Hungary. The Ukrainians are fighting to stop this progression.

Two days later:  no reports of ammunition shipments, no pull out.

This is, IMO, disinformation designed at drawing Ukrainian forces to Bakhmut in advance of a possible spring offensive launched against Crimea.

4622 It is possible that Russia feels as prepared for a counter attack as they can be so he is playing up extra weakness of their forces to try and get Ukraine to attack before the weather, ground and combat supplies are at their peak.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4623 >	‚ÄúRussia is on the brink of catastrophe‚Ä¶‚Äù

Russia‚Äôs population problem has had them marching toward a catastrophe for decades. This is one of the reasons Putin is attempting to annex territories and kidnap Ukrainian children; he needs young people to pay for the social services of his aging population. Now, with the war taking hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men, the situation will be even worse when they lose this war.

The catastrophe was always coming. It will just arrive earlier now. Russia is _fucked_ long-term, war or no war.

>	‚ÄúWe need to stop deceiving the population and telling them that everything is fine‚Ä¶‚Äù

You can‚Äôt. The Russian population is made up of three major groups:

1.	~25% who are against the regime; they may protest, but they know they‚Äôre a minority, and they are easily crushed.
2.	~25% who support the regime; they will support your war, but be careful because they might get a bit overzealous and demand that you actually win it.
3.	~50% who are not the least bit politically active; they will tell you they don‚Äôt follow politics, don‚Äôt care, and don‚Äôt feel they have any say whatsoever; they are easily manipulated because they are low-information citizens.

This is ideal for an authoritarian regime. They want to keep #1 low to prevent revolution. They want to keep #2 low so they don‚Äôt get out of hand, but they still want to be able to rile them up when needed. They want to keep #3 right where it is because they don‚Äôt want too many people having opinions.

This works if you can promise the people in the middle‚Äîthat ~50% who just want to go about their lives and not have the government ask them for anything‚Äîthat they will be able to live a roughly middle-class existence. When you cannot do that, you run the risk of activating them politically, and that means a potential off-with-their-heads moment for the ruling class.

>	‚ÄúThe army has everything‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

No, they don‚Äôt. They were sent to Ukraine with tanks that had cardboard where the armor should have been. That‚Äôs just one example of the boys in procurement pocketing the cash meant for equipment. Grunts we‚Äôre also stealing anything not nailed down and selling it. There was little oversight because the rot was top-down.

>	‚ÄúWhat have we even done [since Feb. 24]? We‚Äôve turned the Russian army ‚Äì the second army in the world ‚Äì into what?"

That was _always_ a fantasy, and the West swallowed it hook, line, and sinker, too. The Russian military is an underfunded, poorly-trained organization using tactics and a command structure from 75 years ago full of miserable conscripts and thieves who never thought they'd go to war. This led to widespread theft of funds and equipment. They'd hobbled themselves long before Ukraine was even on the menu.

Russia is a kleptocracy. This is what happens In kleptocracies.

> Last week Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal met with Francis at the Vatican and asked him to help return Ukrainian children taken following the Russian invasion.

> &quot;I asked His Holiness to help us return home Ukrainians, Ukrainian children who are detained, arrested, and criminally deported to Russia,&Prime; Shmyhal told the Foreign Press Association after the audience. Francis recalled that the Holy See had facilitated some prisoner exchanges, working through embassies, and was open to Ukraine&#039;s request to reunite Ukrainian children with their families.

I agree that we shouldn't judge with hindsight, and just because the final outcome of the policies is bad does not mean the alternative was automatically better. How many people have really expected full scale invasion of Ukraine ? Also, we have to take into account that as public we might not know everything

States won't necessarily follow a great power's good example, but they'll definitely follow its bad example.

If Russia is allowed to get away with illegally invading Ukraine, annexing territory, committing human rights abuses and other war crimes, then lesser would-be autocrats will try the same.

Peace-seeking states should do more to punish Russia for its war of aggression so the other petty dictators realize they'll suffer unacceptable consequences if they do the same. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4654 oh fuck off. When one country invades another for no reason, and happily commits warcrimes of the type, if not scale of WW2. There is no medium ground. Russia has to get fucked hard in the future, as it has been, to send a message to any nation that thinks shifting borders against international law can in any way have positive results. There are only 2 ways this war ends. Russia fully retreats from all occupied territories (including Crimea) or Ukraine destroys all invaders. (Ukraine may choose negotiations before that, but that is solely up to them) We just need to continue supporting Ukraine until one of the options happen

for those crying about the 'huge amounts of aid' its really a drop in the bucket. The monetary aid numbers usually represent old hardware that we cannot go pay people with anyways, a one time shipping fee to get rid of say old Bradleys, Marders etc and older ammo is cheaper than having that stuff rot in a storage dump for a few more years needing maintenance and then safe disposal. On the flip side, the money set aside goes to local defense manufacturers to replace those older systems. the money stays almost completely within country/coalition, the Ukrainians just take care of old ammo disposal.

the purely monetary aid to keep the Ukrainian nation afloat is an investment into a strong nation of 40 million who will, for generations to come, be strongly western focused. and again, a few billion here or there sounds like a lot, but were talking the West. Its spare change

Lastly, anyone arguing these amounts of money would actually go towards other things has no clue about politics. my favorite is US republicans complaining this aid doesnt go to social programs... after hating on social programs for decades

The destrouction of russian militarism by aiding Ukraine is the bargain of a century. During the cold war, countries were considering nuclear war to end the other. now its a tiny amount of our funds, hardware and ammo, to demilitarize russias conventional forces and economically/demographically cripple the country for generations without any direct war or credible risk of escalation

4676 Verkhovna Rada Comissioner for Human Rights: "putin's decree is aimed at legalizing the forced passporting. It's also to put an end to this process. I think that all citizens of Ukraine who refuse a russian passport will be arrested and kept in captivity on russian territory or in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine."

"I would advise the people in temporarily occupied territories to take a russian passport. We understand this happens under pressure. Take a passport, survive, and wait until we liberate this territory. Or leave this territory in any way through any territory of other countries, but just leave. We understand this is a question of survival."

4688 Aside from the usual obvious reasons such as reclaiming their territory, there's another vitally important reason why Ukraine needs a wide range of support.  

The longer this war drags on the worse the growing poverty crisis the Ukrainians face.  

Here's a brief summary from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-431-of-the-invasion):  
>A growing poverty crisis in Ukraine has led many to turn to Kyiv‚Äôs pawn shops to surrender mobile phones, appliances and other belongings in order to get by. Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution‚Äôs regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.  

There's also an accompanying article on the subject for those who wish to read a bit more. It's titled [Pawn shops and bread queues: poverty grips Ukraine as war drags on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-war-poverty-irpin-pawn-shops-bread-queues).  

With Russia targeting civilian infrastructure and cutting them off from ports to export goods many people are loosing their jobs.  

Here's a quote from that article:  
>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children‚Äôs toys.  

It's truly amazing the resilience the Ukrainians are showing against Putin.  

Here's another quote from that article which shows how some non-military support is helping Ukraine in this time of crisis:  
>The economist Olena Bilan sees a deepening crisis, but says that without a huge package of financial support from the international community, including pledges worth $43bn (¬£34bn), the situation would be worse.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen GDP decline by 30% in large part because Ukraine exports 80% of its goods through ports it no longer has access too. We‚Äôve had inflation of 26% ‚Äì again which could have been worse ‚Äì but people‚Äôs salaries have also been flat and the currency has devalued against the dollar by 20%. The biggest challenge is going to be how to create new jobs.‚Äù  

It's just like people have been saying since the start of this war. During this time of crisis Ukraine needs a wide range of support, not just the obvious military equipment, military intelligence support, training, etc.

4701 It's obvious this is a last ditch effort from Russia before the launch of the counter offensive. I know it might look grim tight now, but this is not something the ZSU/AFU didn't anticipate.

Remember Ukraine used to be in the same military as the Russians so they know what to expect and how they think. 

And the western allies of Ukraine are way too involved in this fight to just ignore it if Ukraine is crippled by this attack(which I doubt will happen). 

Trust in the superior tactical knowledge of the Ukrainian commanders, they have not shown themselves to be impulsive, foolish or plain dumb like the Russians have. 

All Russia can do is react, not act in their own tactical interest. 

The thing I'm worried about most right now are the Ukrainian civilians possibly caught in the crossfire or deliberately targeted by the Fashniks..

4702 üßµGiven the recent speech by Prigozhin, it is important to clarify the situation in Bakhmut. Based on compiled information that I am allowed to publish, it is true that Wagner is responsible for assaults and advances in Bakhmut. So why do things look grim on their end? ‚è¨Ô∏è

4705 For over a week, I‚Äôve seen snickering in the Ukrainian Bakhmut channels, things along the lines of‚Äî*yes, we‚Äôve been almost completely pushed out and only hold a few blocks in the west..good, get those Russians pack it like sardines... we will then close the coffin lid....* 

I didn‚Äôt understand the bravado...just today even talking about May 9, and the Russians haven‚Äôt seen anything yet, and how it‚Äôs all a distraction and playing puppets [some bakhmut channels started bickering, bc guys are dying, and folks are acting like it‚Äôs a game....]  My Russian and Ukrainian is limited, I don‚Äôt understand euphemism, colloquialisms, so I assumed what they have been saying was simply lost in translatio.

Looking at old posts from VolyaMedia, where they quote RF Staff Offices, there‚Äôs anxiety that Ukraine has lured RF to Bakhmut‚Äîbut UA is on the precipice of encircling a massive swath of land, much bigger than Bakhmut. That it‚Äôs [Ukraine that‚Äôs made gains north of Bakhmut.](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1r5j2jwIyNBYbs5e-pinvLL_V0i8urcQ&g_ep=CAESCTExLjY2LjYwMhgAQgJVQQ%3D%3D&shorturl=1&ll=48.64761314544245%2C38.06833397579329&z=10)

> According to officers on both sides, the AFU in the city is being attacked but their situation is far from hopeless. **While PMCs and the RF Armed Forces encircle Bakhmut, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are slowly advancing north and south of the Russian positions and can at any moment go forward, arranging a cauldron for those who are trying to surround Bakhmut.**

The Russian Staff Officer:

> > ‚ÄúTwo rings, two ends, and in the middle is Bakhmut. There is matryoshka [encirclement]. **We surround them, but they surround us.** The command insists that the city be completely blocked in the shortest possible time. PMCs have been strengthened, army units have been strengthened by the Airborne Forces, a tank formation, they have been given a weekly ration of shells, they have not yet arrived, but they should be. I do not understand why this is being done, because the situation for our troops is threatening. By cutting off Bakhmut, we ourselves can find ourselves in the ring, and even with the burning middle, which is controlled by the Ukrainians,‚Äù says the Russian staff officer. 

Ukrainian Staff Officer:

> ‚ÄúThe harder they bite into the city, the better for us now. They compactly deploy troops in a small area that can be bypassed from two sides, moreover, quickly. **I won‚Äôt talk about plans, but we have a good chance of organizing the largest encirclement for the Russians since the beginning of the war**,‚Äù explains a Ukrainian staff officer. 


Then, a week later, VolyaMedia again address Bakhmut

> Some Russian staff officers believe that after the "victory" [in Bakhmut] the RF Armed Forces will be in big trouble, because the Armed Forces of Ukraine can strike southwest and northeast of the city. If they cannot be repulsed, **then not only the newly captured city will be lost, but also the Russian group that fought for it.**

Russian Staff Officer:

> > ‚ÄúA lot of artillery and fresh units arrived at the other side (AFU). They hold their positions, efficiently and prudently, and are clearly preparing for offensive operations. And our command has some moods [fantasies] for a parade. Now let's take the last quarters and report on the victory. They will report, and our Slav brothers will bleed us here. [RF wants a parade to celebrate Bakhmut, but the AFU is just going to recapture it.] They will strike from Kurdyumovka and Vesely and meet in Popasna already. The entire sector of the front will fall in three days,‚Äù says the Russian officer. 

> The Ukrainian military refused to comment on these assumptions of the enemy, saying only that the situation is complicated. 



I never understood all that cryptic bravado until now.   Even last night, the bakhmut channels were teasing of what is to come.

> "Concerning possible financing needs for 2024, this also will be huge," Marchenko said, adding: "I think that it will not be an easy task for us to decrease drastically our expenses. Of course it depends on the military campaign, but I think it could be no less than the ‚Ç¨18 billion as we [had] for this year." 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4727 During war, it's quite hard to keep economy up when you are being invaded, areas occupied, infrastructure bombed, lots of people moved inside and outside the country and significant number of people serving in the military.

So this year, EU is spending at least ‚Ç¨18 billion on macro-financial assistance to state of Ukraine (so to finance government spending), and US was spending at least $10 billion on financial assistance. These numbers don't include any material and military support or aid from individual EU countries. Ukraine's state budget on year 2021 was around ‚Ç¨50 billion, so ‚Ç¨28 billion is a significant sum. Without it, Ukraine would have serious difficulties financing state budget, because for Ukraine it's hard to get loans from private market, because private investors see the risks high because of the war. Of course it's always possible to print hryvnias, but on this scale it would lead to hyperinflation.

Before the war, Ukraine didn't receive bacically any money from EU, then Ukraine's state budget was financed completely by taxation and loans from private market.

Is ‚Ç¨18 billion a significant sum for EU? Well, it's always a significant sum. But to put it in perspective, EU's yearly budget is around ‚Ç¨170 billions, and ‚Ç¨250 billions if also counting nextgenEU funds. But EU's budget is small compared to the sum of state budgets in the EU (because EU's tasks are so limited), which is many thousands of billions of euros, in Germany alone ‚Ç¨1800bn (this is probably sum of both federal+local). So compared to that, ‚Ç¨18 billions is macro-financially insignificant for the whole EU.

It would be very silly to let the state of Ukraine into deep financial turmoil and hyperinflation, when in the same time when we're sending them much larger sums of aid in form of military aid. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4728 Just give Ukraine the 330 billion the EU seized from Russia. Then Ukraine can pay for the aid with actual money and get all of the weapons systems they want. Meanwhile the money goes back into circulation, the EU gets another trading partner and Russia loses it's shit while the world laughs at them. Ukraine also has funding to rebuild paid for by the same country that broke their shit. 

It's like the perfect solution.

Because outside that, there isn‚Äôt much more they can do. The idea is to hopefully ‚Äúscare‚Äù the West into losing its mettle. To eventually push Ukraine to call for peace or reduce support for funding Ukraine.

4782 Accorsing to Russian nuclear discipline, deploying nukes abroad requires multiple steps. One, rhetoric. Two, demonstrating readiness of the nuclear forces - this happened way back last year. Three, test explosion within Russia. And the fourth is the actual deployment abroad. Now they seem to be spreading misinfo about step three. In context with recent Ukrainian comments that 'no nukes will be deployedbwhen we retake Crimea', it seems like they actually want to escalate the situation.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4791 Russia is effectively ridding themselves of all dissenters and criminals. They are expending soviet Era stockpiles almost exclusively. While it looks like they are taking losses, they are losses that have no real impact on their ability to launch a real war, losses that result in greater social control, and losses that open up munitions warehouse space. They retain their primary military, while also drastically increasing recruitment beyond replacement levels for current or projected attrition in Ukraine.

If anything, they are growing leaner and more efficient as a wartime nation. Everything going on right now, even this announcement, points at Russia girding themselves for a major conflict. Ukraine is likely just a feint to draw our resources to Europe. I fully expect a front along the Mexican border if things continue along their current trajectory. We abused our southern neighbors for too long and opened the door for [Russian political infiltration](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-lifestyle-mexico-europe-friendships-6e59bf618d045f937fb0bf5412afc734). Our southern border is the only soft entry point for large groups of troops, and it would only require cartel collaboration.

4797 Too many people here are taking Prigozhins words for anything. He's pretty good at playing the media game. Chances are this is (once more) just a try to 1) muddy the waters for the international community so that it becomes harder to see the truth and 2) put pressure on russian internal politics to get more supplies. He knows that Russia is uncomfortably reliant on his elite force, and he plays this to get as much out of it as humanly possible.  


Wagner really is two groups in one - yes, there are the cannon fodder conscripts, but they also actually are an elite force in parts. Underestimating them is an easy way to get rolled, and I fear that the western public is all to eager to disregard their potential. Luckily, ukrainian command isn't and actually takes them seriously.

4824 [part two]

In addition to reading the Russian news in a ‚Äòknow thy enemy‚Äô-way, I also like to read comments to gauge Russians‚Äô impressions.  Granted, I have no way of knowing how representative the comments sections are of the sentiments of Russians at large. 

_____

Two days ago, included in the ‚ÄòSVO‚Äô news, was the coverage of a young man from Rostov, sentenced for 4 years, for wanting/planning to go fight on the side of Ukraine. 

In part:

> Preparing for the crime, he monitored the information reports of the combat areas on the border territory of Ukraine, developed a walking route for crossing the state border, bypassing the established checkpoints.

> Also, to confirm his readiness for service, he was going to set fire to the military registration and enlistment office in one of the cities of the central part of Russia, and then send a video report to representatives of the legion.

The sentiment for that was mixed‚Äîsome thought he was a traitor, some thought he likely had UA family‚Äîthe bulk wrote that this was a Sovietesque persecution‚Äîbecause it was a ‚Äúthought crime.‚Äù  That there was no *corpus delecti*, that he was only in the mental preparations stage had not actually *done* anything.  No ‚Äúaction in furtherance of a crime.‚Äù  He was literally just thinking about all this.  The Russians commenting overwhelming saw the prosecution of this worrisome, because no one wants to live in an NK world of there being ‚Äúthought police.‚Äù

____

Yesterday, included in the ‚ÄúSpecial Military Operation‚Äù news was Putin‚Äôs decree regarding deportation.  The way Russian news covered it was to say that those who have not accepted Russian citizenship, will first of all be categorized as foreigners under Russian law.  Then, if they do one of several crimes (disrupt public order, including ‚Äúparticipating in an unsanctioned assembly, rally, demonstration, procession or picketing,‚Äù support extremism or terrorism, etc.) will be handled as when *foreigners* commit *this subcategory of crimes* [ie, not arrested, rather immediately expelled as a *persona non grata*]. ‚ÄúIf such a decision is made, the person is obliged to leave Russia within three calendar days from the date of notification. The document states that those who do not fulfill this obligation are subject to deportation.‚Äù

In the comment section, the Russian readers were not having this.

First, some thought that they ‚Äúshould be‚Äù held to the same repercussions that any Russian is‚Äîprison.

Others thought, well regardless if ‚Äúshould be‚Äù given prison, that this was lies and definitely won‚Äôt be deported and instead will be arrested and imprisoned bc the regime is just that dishonest and repressive.  

But the overwhelming majority didn‚Äôt have a comment on prison versus deportation, but rather, made sarcastic or cynical comments about annexing land under pretense of saving citizens only to expel those citizens. 

Here are *a few* of those comments:


_____

> We continue to save territories from their inhabitants?

_____

> That‚Äôs perfectly fine! For example, some old man from a neighboring apartment comes to me and says, ‚Äòfrom now on, you and I will live *together* in your apartment; and there‚Äôs are a couple of people with me who‚Äôll be here, too.  But if you don't like it, then get out of *your apartment*!!!‚Äô

> > you mean, ‚Äúour apartment.‚Äù

> > > no it‚Äôs, ‚Äúmy apartment.‚Äù


____

> interesting... so, would Putin have had the courage to poke his nose into Ukraine, if Ukraine had time to enter NATO?

_____


> So .... a man lived for himself, by himself, lived in his own place...and then it became the territory of another state and he was deported ....hmmm

____

> but I have a question! here we believe that all sorts of banned Western liberal funds are trying to ruin our state, but really, think about it, if you look at what our leader did contributing to the collapse of the country's economy over the last 20 years, and the loss of respect towards our state on the world stage‚Äîthen our leader did more than all these funds and other liberal journalists and Westerners! really he managed to undermine it all

____

> For some reason, all this news is not at all like what you expect!  Hmm...What kind of ‚ÄúKiev in three days‚Äù is this?  if only some region was liberated or a large city was occupied - the second year of the Special Operation is underway, but we can only boast of Mariupolü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

____

> Before they addressed how to start this Special Operation, it would have been imperative to find out (even if have to buy or steal this information) the ‚Äòrecipe‚Äô how the US Army took Iraq in a monthüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

4825 I wanted to ask a question to wich I can't find the answer. Russia keeps striking civilian homes with their missiles and drones. Why!? 

In my humble opinion it has a few effects and they are all negative for Russia itself. 
1, hardens the resolve of the Ukrainian population and soldiers.
2, missiles are "wasted" because they could help them in the destruction of Ukrainian military assets. 
3, I'm not sure but those missiles must be expensive and limited in supply.
4, the international community and population becomes more willing to supply weapons for the defence of Ukrainian. (Dead children is not a good image) and I hope even alot of Russians must not like seeing dead children... 

So what is the gain in doing it?

Edit: if I may recap the answers (and thank you everyone!) 

1, They need to show something to the higher ups, even if it's a useless lie.  
2, they have stupid assumptions about what it might achieve in the Ukrainian population. 
3, they simply have little capacity to hit something relevant. 
4, some retarded show of how strong they are to the home front and the world. (Working out great guys)
5, Ukraine is lucky that they are very stupid.

4827 Curious, I occasionally look at how the Russians covered recent news.  The local/regional news covers *primarily* obits be their local guys.

But there is other news, and surprisingly, it has included news that is somewhat unflattering to Russia, though the details are always very slim.

[part one] 

For example, local press covered that Xi and Zelensky spoke, and that Zelensky told Xi that there‚Äôs an easy peace plan and that‚Äôs for Russia to leave and the 1991 borders be adhered to. 

**Today, local Russian press had 2 major bits‚Äîand they were printed together as** ***News of the Day***‚Äî**and taken together‚Äîwill absolutely cause trepidation amongst the Russians.**

**First, it covered the major fire in Crimea**‚Äîand despite the Russians saying how air defense works, there was many daunting, frightening pictures/gifs/videos of the absolutely massive damage.  Which made the Russian assurances appear preposterous. And would undoubtedly cause nervous feelings, even far away from the action. 

**Second: Coupled with such imagery, was information about Ukraine‚Äôs upcoming counteroffensive, including many quotes from Zelensky himself**.  So after the scary photos, the Russian press basically published Zelensky saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre coming for Crimea.‚Äù [Edit: they quote from an interview Zelensky gave *a different news agency.*]

Here‚Äôs what was written in one newspaper from a midsized city wrote:

> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the Ukrainian military is planning a counteroffensive. In an interview with *Yle*, he said that Ukraine "will be able to repel Russian forces, as well as return the Crimean peninsula under control."

> Zelensky noted that the success of Ukraine largely depends on the supply of weapons by the West.

> ‚ÄúWe want to save as many lives as possible, so the number of weapons matters,‚Äù the Ukrainian president said. ‚ÄúIt is cheaper for other countries to support Ukraine now than to increase the risks of a Third World War.‚Äù

> Zelensky did not name the timing of the counteroffensive. According to *Yle*, this will happen in late spring or early summer.

> The founder of Wagner PMC, Yevgeny Prigozhin, suggested that the Ukrainian counteroffensive would be carried out before May 15. He expressed this opinion in a video interview with journalist Semyon Pegov.

Please, no likes, not upvotes, no awards.  If you read this out in the ether, then make your own comment so we can all surpass the 1000 mark daily and keep the issue relevant.  

Please donate with just a few words and a comment.   Nothing more. It means a lot. Just go to the comment box and say "I support Ukraine". Simple.  I might get shade because it's not news.  News won't show if we don't crack the 1000 mark every day.  Just say Hi..I support.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4843 Sadly it seems pretty clear this creep will use them.  If Ukraine successfully pushes the invader back far enough that Russia thinks it will lose its foothold, Putin will use battlefield nukes.  The idea would not be to turn the tide of battle, but to shock the world and freeze the situation on the ground. He would count on western countries, staring into a nuclear abyss, to pressure Ukraine into territorial concessions. All the debate around whether he will use them are about psychology.  How isolated and deluded is he?  How grandiose is he? He stopped being rational actor when he invaded. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4844 This may be in light of russia pulling a substantial number of its military assets out of Crimea, the US may suspect russia will let Ukraine take it with enough resistance to encourage Ukraine to send a sizeable force there, then nuke it. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4845 Many people seem to think that Putin "nuking" Ukraine means he's going to launch a dozen ICBM's and reduce the country to rubble. There's basically zero chance of this happening.

What's much more likely is he will order tactical strikes with low-yield nukes as a way to deny a counter offensive. If he's "smart", he would target uninhabited areas to prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing. This puts things in more of a grey area for NATO, even though they said ANY use of nuclear weapons would result in a swift conventional response. It's harder for them to justify getting involved in the war when nukes are only being used defensively.

I hope that he isn't desperate enough to do this, but it's within the realm of possibility if he gets desperate enough. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4846 The reality is Putin put faith in his intelligence and his military systems, and now their facing a better armed Ukraine with proven western supplies and equipment.  I suspect at this time he has to question the chips he has left to play on the table. 

The nuclear card puts the expanse of Putin‚Äôs military complex in the crosshairs. If the performance in Ukraine is any qualifier, i doubt if Putin is ready to gamble to that extent.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4862 Well considering Brazil is a founding member of the united nations I would say it's absolutely up to Brazil's leader to have a say in what country Crimea belongs too. Especially since an invasion that is disrupting global order is taking place based heavily on the concept of which country Crimea belongs too.


More specifically it's up to Lula to determine his countries stance on the validity of the treaties signed by Russia and ukraine including the Budapest memorandum on security assurances in 1991 where Russia promised to respect Crimea as a territory of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine relinquishing their nuclear arsenal..... And the validity of the partition treaty which Russia terminated in 2014.

Lulas stance has an even greater implication on Brazil's recognition of treaties in general and how valid they are under which circumstances.

Russia invaded a sovereign nation under contrived pretenses and then committed war crimes.

That info is nearly 10 years out of date.

Azov had significant nationalist elements in it before it went professional and joined the Ukrainian armed forces, in 2014. Then that element almost entirely left.

And it's strange how this is regularly still called out, when that element was never as far-right as the Russian government now is. Yet the Russian government is seldom referred to as far-right.

Elderly citizens have been fooled into creating bombs and attempting to burn down buildings by scammers pretending to work for banks.

The Russian government has not commented on the matter.

4892 I know it‚Äôs impossible to predict, and I am not even qualified to be an armchair general, but let‚Äôs assume the counter offensive is happening or does happen in the next couple weeks. Where would the counteroffensive be launched, and what are the immediate objectives?

My guess (and it truly is a guess) is that Ukraine would push south from Zaporizhzia to Melitopol as well as across the river from Kherson. It seems to me the most effective thing to do would to both cut off the land route in Ukraine to Crimea as well as damming the canal to deny access to water for Crimea. I really don‚Äôt know if there will be much movement on the Donbas front/area unless an opportunity presents itself.

4900 This stage in the war is the one that I most dread. It's a catch-22 if Ukraine starts beating Russia back and gets close to recapturing Crimea. Russia could escalate more. 

However, it is also likely that if Russia is going to pop off with tactical nukes or any other extreme escalation Putin would do it soon. Either Putin may want to halt the Ukrainian advance or cut them off from Crimea entirely with a little radiation. I'm not fear mongering I just believe Putin is a particularly ruthless bastard.

4919 Okay, so we are talking about a guy who is forced to use WWII equipment and another 400k conscripts because he already blew through (or rather, the Ukraine Army did) the first 300k conscripts.

He can't get enough manpower for his industrial needs, let alone his war-machine, he has a terminal brain-drain of his country's talented and skilled workers and designers.  He has had warheads dropped in Moscow and had to give so many of his military and political "leaders" (read as opponents) Russian vacations and trip-hazards that nobody knows what is going on, and even his own hired mercenary groups would rather fight each other than Ukraine.  He has also allegedly attempted to poison one of his only regional allies, and survived a reported assassination attempt.

Now, he thinks he is going to find people to deport other people?  So he is going to deport Ukrainian citizens to... where?  Ukraine?  A place they would rather be?

I doubt he will be around when his deadline expires. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4920 It's pretty cool when they write down and sign their literal intent to commit genocide. 

This leads me to my second point. It, to me, is pretty morally unacceptable that western nations stand around with their hands in their pockets watching an announced and clear genocide occuring. Yes we are helping with arms and cash.. thats great, even as slow as its been. But there has been way too much talk lately about what the ukrainians might or might not be able to take back or that they have "one shot" .

Sorry.. a western/eu/ally/US/Nato or whatever combo of countries air force could easily destroy and remove the russian military from all of Ukraine in a matter of weeks. No ground forces needed. No need to invade russia .. but we just refuse to do it. I don't get it. Russia is not going to suicide themselves by attacking another country or get St Petersburg and Moscow glassed by nuking someone over crimea. It is not morally correct to allow the genocide of Ukrainians in any part of Ukraine occupied or other. And it is not strategically advantageous for the west to allow russia to come out of this with any gain in territory.. .BECAUSE THEY WILL CLEARLY TRY FOR MORE. Next year or next decade they will try again. .

Its getting somewhat evil to stand around watching when you absolutely have the power to end it with virtually no threat to yourself. I'm sure you could find many many western pilots willing to volunteer.

4933 Brilliant. Absolute pure fucking genius. Rip hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes that you‚Äôve invaded and annexed, and then ship them off to a country you‚Äôre actively at war with.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
4936 I'm seeing several comments that are some variation of "why bother doing this now?" There's an answer to that that I haven't seen show up yet in this discussion. Which is that Russia has a serious, major problem with Ukrainian dissidents in the occupied territories.

One of the miscalculations Russia made at the beginning of all this was mistaking "pro Russian sentiment" for "wanting to be annexed". They saw people saying "Yeah I like the Russians as neighbors" and thought these other would support becoming Russians. But obviously that wasn't the case.

And now they have significant numbers of people in the occupied territories phoning the Ukrainian military to report Russian troop movements and the location of command offices. That is, when they aren't literally blowing up traitors supporting the occupation. Furthermore, that resistance is about to become a whole lot more useful when Ukraine starts attacking with a couple thousand new NATO armored vehicles.

Russia is desperate to prevent locals from providing intel to the incoming liberators. Because, unlike the Russian military, the Ukrainians have precision weapons and know how to use them.

4943 Historically deporting Ukrainians to Siberia served three uses. 


1. Colonise Siberia, displacing native native people from their land.

2. Russify the deported Ukrainians, as they became further separated from their homeland through time and distance.

3. Colonise Ukraine. Specifically Kuban.

She has spoken out against Russian war crimes in the council of Europe, especially on war rape. Her party (one of the two dominant parties in Norway, the most pro-NATO and pro-EU party here) is also entirely pro-Ukraine in every way, and the rest of the Norwegian delegation voted in favour.

4961 Probably, Putin's Russia might not understand the current situation. If Russia would like to finish this war peacefully without more casualties, the regime shouldn't have launched this attack. Zelenskyy's government can assault massively Russia's territories if the US gives Ukraine a chance to destroy many Russian cities. 

Strategic mistakes or errors like this would be the main reason making Russia hopeless. Hypersonic with nuclear weapons? No, that would become the shortcut to be destroyed by the US's ultimate weapon "Minuteman 3". Most Russian high officials don't want to give Putin's regime a piece of rational advice to dodge Putin's madness. That's the problem. I dare say if someone gives Putin some advice to stop this war, all of them would be dead bodies after a few days.

&#x200B;

>KHARKIV, Ukraine  
When Fuminori Tsuchiko arrived in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv last year, he said he wanted to do anything he could to help people following Russia's invasion.  
Moved by the plight of residents forced by Russian shelling to shelter in subway stations, the 75-year-old Japanese national from Tokyo decided to stay.  
For months, he said, he lived in a metro station and worked as a volunteer distributing food in the subway.  
He and a Ukrainian he met in the station have now opened a free cafe in Kharkiv's Saltivka neighborhood - mainly thanks to what he said were donations made by Japanese people via social media.  
"June, July, August, September, October, November, December - (for) seven months I stayed in the metro, underground, sleeping or eating, and together (with) many, many Ukrainian people," Tsuchiko said.  
FuMi Caffe serves about 500 people a day, he said.  
Tsuchiko said he had been visiting Ukraine as a tourist in February 2022, when the Japanese embassy urged him to leave as Russia prepared to invade. He went to the Polish capital Warsaw but said he returned two months later.

4989 Zelenskyy: Russia's deportation of Ukrainian children 'an attempt to erase the identity of our people'
Yesterday we reported that the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly had described child deportations from Ukraine to Russia as genocide.

Late last night, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy described this as "an important political result".

"This is the first recognition of this fact at the level of such a high international organisation uniting the states of our continent," he said in his nightly address.

"Practically speaking, this decision will significantly help our global efforts to bring Russia and its officials, including the head of the terrorist state, to justice for genocide and genocidal policies against Ukraine.

The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the fully premeditated elements of Russia's attempt to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. This is a deliberate crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. This is how it should be qualified both politically and legally."

Mr Zelenskyy said that all levels of the Ukrainian government would keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the "punishment" of Russia.

"We know for sure the data of almost 20,000 children who were taken away and dispersed to different regions of the evil state.

"But it is obvious that this is only a part of much larger criminal actions. There may be many more such children.

"Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to exterminate peoples.

"It is through the Russian example - the accountability of this state and its officials guilty of genocide - that we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that there will never be impunity.

"There will be sentences for genocide. Just as for all other crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine and our people."

In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russia's president Vladimir Putin, accusing him of abducting children from Ukraine.

It also issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children, on similar allegations.

A few days ago, Dom Nicholls mentioned on the Telegraph podcast the idea of Ukrainians secretly purchasing Russian army tank engine parts and other valuable military materials from corrupt Russian officials in order to further erode their war effort.

Is this something that could actually work in practice? Has this ever been tried before?

5005  You can hear the Rumbling: The Ukrainian counter-offensive is shaping up: Raids, deep strikes, reports that the Ukrainians have already slipped across the Dnipro River. And the more the Ukrainian Military tries to ‚Äòdownplay‚Äô expectations, the more likely a thunderclap is coming soon. It looks like the South is the target, but then the Ukrainians are great at masking their real intentions. Wagner forces think it will be a backlash in Bakhmut, but the regular Russian Military is intent on breaking up a Southern thrust, although they seem to be hitting more apartment buildings and daycares than Ukrainian troop concentrations. Russian defenses look formidable but so did Saddam‚Äôs. They are stretched to the max. Hopefully, the Ukrainians have enough striking power. All promised armored vehicles and some tanks are now in their hands. We are entering a dangerous time. What will be Putin‚Äôs response if his forces fold like a House of Cards? He won‚Äôt be able to get Xi to the negotiating table fast enough.

5006 Out of curiosity, does anyone know why Ukraine chose to peg their currency to USD at the start of the war? I understand the purpose of pegging it in general, in combination with good fiscal and monetary policy and international assistance, it helped to stabilize Ukraines economy. I‚Äôm more curious why they chose the dollar rather than the euro. I would think they do more trade with the eu than the us. Is there something about the dollar that makes it more beneficial to peg to than the euro for them? Or something about the euro that makes it less beneficial?

Edit: Lots of good answers in the comments, thank you everyone! For anyone stumbling across this, here‚Äôs an updated list of possible reasons:

-	USD is a more popular global reserve currency
-	USD is more common in international arms trading
-	While it didn‚Äôt happen, there was potential of the Euro being destabilized by the gas crisis
-	The EU and other countries are likely more used to dealing with USD than the US and other countries are with Euros
-	The US may be better able to help Ukraine maintain the peg than the EU is


I‚Äôm not sure if any one of these is sufficient to explain why Ukraine chose USD instead of the Euro, but combined (and probably with even more reasons no one has said yet) they do make a compelling argument for USD. Thanks again everyone!

5008 This is putting the cart well before the horse, but I hope the West has the stomach for what will have to happen in order to de-occupy the territory that's been taken. Liberation isn't complete when the Armed Forces of Ukraine drive out the enemy. Russia imports civilian occupiers to solidify their hold, particularly in Crimea and the so-called L/DNR. For those lands to be liberated, there has to be mass deportations along the lines of the post-WW2 German population transfers. It will be an ugly business, but Ukraine can't have a stable future with a hostile, Russian population within its borders.

They don‚Äôt have everything they need to finish the drive, but they have enough to start it.  They will most likely have the goal of splitting the land bridge‚Äîwhether that is through Kherson, Zaporizhye, or Donetsk.  Severing the line/driving to the Azov Sea.  Once do that, will have to attack Russians from three sides [so if pushed back to berdyansk, for example, would have RF to East, West, and south ie sea]‚Äîhowever‚ÄîRussians will have a difficult time continuing to equip, which is what need.

5015 PACE recognises deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia as genocide 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
5016 The resolution titled "Deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators" was adopted in Strasbourg.  
"The Assembly underscores that the forcible transfer of children from one group to another group, with the intention to destroy, totally or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group is considered as a crime of genocide under Article 2 paragraph (e) of the 1948 Genocide Convention, which matches with the documented evidence of deportation and forcible transfer of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation or territories temporarily under Russian occupation," the resolution states.  
The document reports that the illegal deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation from the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts started before the beginning of the full-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine, when children from orphanages and disabled children were deported. The PACE called upon the International Criminal Court (ICC) to consider the possibility of criminal responsibility for this crime.

5017 Rafa≈Ç Lemkin is the man who coined the word ‚ÄúGenocide.‚Äù He cited the Holodomor (a famine weponized by Russia against the Ukrainian people and their culture in the 1930s) as an example of genocide. His definition influenced the Nuremberg Trials, and our current laws surrounding genocide. His work ‚Äú Soviet Genocide in the Ukraine‚Äù is illegal to distribute in Russia.

What‚Äôs sad is Russia has already attempted to destroy Ukrainian people and culture. Now they are doing it again. I‚Äôm hopeful they will fail again, because this time around the World is watching and they care.

5019 So confused, what is this about? The article makes it sounds like this is about stopping nations to not deport Ukrainian refugees back to Russian and note Russian occupied Ukrainian territories. This kinda makes sense cuz who and how you deport Ukrainian babies to Russia? 

However, it also mentioned this targets Russian officials? I am just so confused about what this thing it is that they are trying to stop? Do they mean relocation of civilians from occupied territories to Russia? But that is not deportation at all.

5020 This is very very bad. They are hoping to train more meat shields for future engagements. In addition to needing more manpower and soldiers, Russia desperately wants to ethnically purify the Ukrainians. 

People cannot just be imported and stolen from their homeland like cattle for this unjust cause. This sets a terrible precedent and is a sign of what atrocities they will commit en masse when they have full control of Ukraine.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5035 This article outlines some noticed changes in Russian submarine operations in the Atlantic which are to be expected considering the current posturing of the West and Russia. It goes on to suggest that we must take care in assessing the Russian military as a whole based on events in Ukraine. The logic is fairly straightforward. Russian ground forces have been severely degraded due to casualities, supply shortages, as well as inherent flaws in their command structure. However, there are aspects of their military that have not made an appearance that should not be underestimated. They retain a large submarine fleet and have built numerous new subs in the past two decades. It is a stark reminder that despite their struggles in Ukraine, evident quality control/maintenance, and lack of airpower and naval parity with the west, a hot war with the US/NATO could look alot different in the way it is fought than one with Ukraine.

Please dont misinterpret that. I am not suggesting Russia has any sort of advantage over the West. I am suggesting that they should not be underestimated despite their failings in Ukraine. NATO is not undersestimating them, but I think alot of the general public is. I think it is best to be cautious making summary judgements about the state of their boomer fleet or rocketry forces based on what has played out in Ukraine. It is even possible that Russia is more dangerous than ever due to the failings of their conventional forces. If the Ukrainian counter offensive really makes some noise and puts the Russian military on their heels or their ass, we may see a shift in strategy by Russia. None of this suggests that the West should back off, but does suggest that we all go into it eyes wide open.

5049 Russia has emptied out a Crimea base of weaponry, with officials worried Ukraine could target the region in a possible counteroffensive 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
5050 Sergei Aksyonov, the Russia-appointed governor of Crimea, said earlier this month that Russia was building defensive structures in and around Crimea, indicating that Russia expects a Ukrainian attack. He said that they "had to prepare for any scenario," per CNN's translation.The governor of Crimea's largest city said earlier this week that Ukrainian drones had targeted Russia's main naval base there. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that he wants to take Crimea back.

Ukraine has been gearing up for a long-awaited counteroffensive, including by getting more advanced training and weapons from its allies. But it isn't clear when it will begin.  
Crimea has a strategic military importance: Russia uses it to support its troops in Ukraine's south, and it is home to multiple military bases and airports, as well as Russia's Black Sea Fleet. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5051 This is now the scary part about the war. Firstly, will Russia use tactical nukes as a way of deterrence? Ukraine is taking back Crimea, although it is very well known that Russia practically owns that land or something like that. Either way, if Russia does not use Nukes prior or after Ukraine possibly gets Crimea back, then I think we are safe. 

Russia has the means and the determination to let everything go at once. 6-7k nukes can destroy the world multiple times over and there's nothing that can stop it.

5060 It's impossible to say how much Ukraine requires - so much is contingent on known and unknown variables.  M1s and Bradley's will outclass Russia's armour, but anti-tank weapons like Kornet pose a greater threat than what M1 has faced in the past.  They will need to be very smart and lucky given Russia's advantage in mass and numbers.  Getting conscripts to defend positions with AT weapons is also a much better proposition for Russia than getting to attack successfully.  I have no idea how this will play out.

5063 It is actually important that the counter offensive finds success. After this, when would there be another opportunity? Part of me would love see a massive push like kharkiv. On paper, it looks bigger from what we saw in kharkiv. Another side recognizes that a smaller offensive might be better for sustained success. 

Artillery will still dictate what is possible in the opening days of the offensive. Have all the armor that you want but if the second line can get their artillery where it needs to be then the outcome might be different. Armor will not deflect artillery. 

Kharkiv was a specific environment that worked with more out of less. Russians did not have manned defenses in key areas. The Ukrainians did not encounter a second line ready to suppress the offensive which is why they reached the oskil River and izium. Afterwards, the Russians retreated and Ukraine had to fight tooth and nail to go any further but nearly reached svatove before the line reconstituted itself.

5067 It is hard to see a scenario where Russia wins this. The US is literally sending them their scraps and Ukraine is holding them off. The NATO mobilization of equipment has started to hit its stride. All of Europe is sending armor. Russia‚Äôs main supplier of military equipment was Ukraine which is obviously not sending them anything now. 

Russia has no NCO org which is critical to modern warfare. They literally have an org structure that is closer to the times of the czars than modern military organizations. They rape their women nurses as a standard practice. Literally assigning the women to specific officers when deployed. These women are raped so often they seem to think it is just the way things are and just deal with it. 

The US could eject Russia from Ukraine in a few weeks if they they actually bothered to do it.

5071 Summary:

Italy's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, announced that Italy will collaborate with the European Union to provide military support for Ukraine's defense, but has no intention of attacking Russia. 

The EU plans to increase support for peace and reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, with Italy acting within the framework of the EU, NATO, G-7, and other relevant organizations. 

Tajani highlighted the importance of China's engagement with Russia to end the invasion. The Italian government will actively participate in Ukraine's rebuilding, involving around 1,000 companies in an event in Rome. 

Tajani also mentioned that Italy has diversified its natural gas sources, moving away from Russia, and aims to be a significant energy hub in the Mediterranean Sea. He expressed high expectations for the partnership between Japan, Britain, and Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet, which could benefit the civilian sector.

5080 Does Zelenskyy really sees the "opportunity" as he is saying?

I really doubt it. 

The way he is playing the field is incredibly smart though. I hope that people understand that he is also keeping "an open mind" so to say, so the narrative still is that Ukraine is open to negotiations to end this mayhem.

The moment that he gives the idea that he isn't open for these "negotiations" is the moment that some (you know who) countries are gonna try to shift the narrative that Ukraine isn't open for negotiations and that they actually don't want peace etc..

Zelenskyy's hands are "tied" but not in the bad sense of the meaning. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5081 The deadliest moment of war is before peace talk.  

Both sides will want to be on the side with positions' advantages before sitting on the negotiation table.  Ukraine and Russia will continue to fight for territory until they both agree to come to the negotiation table.  

Hence, what China did was just set the stage of eventual talk.  Europe seems to support the initiative while supporting Ukraine to gain a favourable position.

One possibility would be to end the war, withdraw from all Ukrainian territory occupied since 2014, return all the kidnapped Ukrainians and set up a scheme to fund Ukrainian reconstruction. It goes without saying that Russia has no right to interfere in other nations' internal affairs such as which continental unions or military alliances they join.

Another way would be to reorganize their society to work around the sanctions - limit loads on these roads, prioritize them for maintenance and expansion, and things like that.

Address of the Melitopol partisans regarding the work done and the recent liquidation of the collaborator.
  
‚ÄúAnd good morning again, dear residents of Melitopol. Sorry for the loud sound this morning. We cleaned up the garbage: eliminated the Judas of the traitor Alexander Mishchenko, who, taking care of his own skin, worked as the enemy's deputy head of the Department of Internal Affairs. Once again we warn all the traitors of Ukraine who have no moral guidelines. Boys, you are like in the horror movie "Final Destination" and your destination is the morgue and we will send you there.

5108 In March I had a Lyft driver with broken English but I recognised some Ukrainian words from his phone so started talking.

He was from Bucha. Russians said they'd murder his child unless he gave them everything. After liberation,  the recruitment office rejected him on medical grounds so he took his family to San Diego. Russian lies about Bucha being fake make me sick. 

I often think about him - if you're reading this, I hope you and your family are ok. My friends were affected and I pointed them straight to [United24](https://u24.gov.ua/), so it helped Ukraine too. Keep telling your story!

5113 > The Ukrainians seem to be slowly pulling out to the edge of Bakhmut, see the most up to date Deep State Map. Its a vindication of their decision to force the Russians to fight for the city for the last few months and an example of the fundamental weaknesses in Russian war making.

> The last thing a competent military that could execute combined arms would have done would be to bash through the city. They would have focussed on cutting off the Ukrainians in the bulge.

> The Russians could not do that, even though they had the Ukrainians in a vulnerable position. Instead they have gone slowly and self-destructively right through the city, and the Ukrainians are still there, able to pull back in good order, never cut off.

> It was certainly why all senior Ukrainian officials I talked with, civilian and military, were adamant that fighting for Bakhmut was in Ukraine's interest and to Ukraine's advantage--and they were right.

I know we‚Äôve heard ‚ÄúBakhmut is falling‚Äù a million times by now but it‚Äôs pretty close to being true. Instead of a quick and easy victory Russia has bled themselves out and used up vast quantities of manpower and firepower in the city. Ukraine could probably reinforce Bakhmut but at this point it‚Äôs served it‚Äôs purpose and has pushed Russian casualties to unacceptable levels while also giving Ukraine time to fortify areas farther back. The defenders of Bakhmut are heroes and the Russian losses sustained will be an important part of any Ukrainian successes in the coming months.

5118 Adviser to the President of Ukraine on children's rights: "The children that were kidnapped by Russia are constantly moved, so that we don't have time to get information. Children were abducted during "filtering". Parents are detained, children are removed. Or russians kidnap children directly, when they deprive adults, who do not want to cooperate with the occupiers, of parental rights. Or they offer parents to give the child for so-called vacation for a month. Then, these children were told that their parents got rid of them, that they will go to russian families." 

"In Russia, there is a ban on everything Ukrainian for them. They are forbidden to communicate in Ukrainian, they study russian history, culture.¬†If the children refused to start the day in the camp with the song "Forward, Russia", they were beaten or put in basements, they were not fed.¬†On the "Children of War" portal, you can see the story of 16-year-old Vladyslav, detained for 90 days. He was not tortured, but he was forced to clean torture rooms." https://24tv.ua/deportatsiya-ditey-skilki-ditey-vivezli-ukrayini-rosiyu-intervyu_n2295843 (interview)

5120 I‚Äôm a fervent supporter of Ukrainian military, and that includes their decisions.  

Several soldiers who are in Bakhmut, as well as the UA milbloggers, are saying to not feel defeated if UA is fully pushed out [on the cusp of that], or betrayed by command‚Äôs decision if ordered to withdraw tonight or next couple days.  That we need to see Bakhmut not in terms of a city and held or lost, but rather, see it as an operation, ordered to arrest the progress of Russians, distract them from other directions, and if the command says the operation is over, then we leave, having completed the task.

We, here, should all keep this in mind, too.

5123 I wonder if it would be better for Ukraine to start its counter-offensive, if they can, while Russia is still fighting for Bakhmut, rather than after they have fully captured it and can release a lot of men and equipment to the rest of the frontline. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5124 I think people‚Äôs expectations of the counteroffensive are far too high. Retaking Crimea is a very high bar. Those suggesting Ukraine could entirely push Russia back to 2014 borders during this counteroffensive alone are just being purely unrealistic.

Of course those are the ultimate goals, but the expectation that they happen in the near-to-medium term is more harmful than good. The exact goals of the counteroffensive aren‚Äôt even known. 

The more people hype up unrealistic goals that might not even align with what Ukraine has in mind, the more the counteroffensive could be perceived as a failure - even if Ukraine accomplishes every goal they had planned internally. 

If all those things happen anyway, of course that‚Äôs fantastic. But it shouldn‚Äôt be the expectation or gauge of success.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5128 People in the west really need to lower expectations of the counter offensive. No matter what happens the Russians are going to try to say ‚Äúthe counter offensive failed‚Äù and use that as a mechanism to make the war look unwinnable for Ukraine to try to get the west to stop sending aid. If the expectation is that ‚ÄúUkraine quickly retakes all of the lost territory and anything else is a failure‚Äù that is an expectation that plays directly into the Kremlin‚Äôs hands. 

We don‚Äôt know what Ukraine‚Äôs overall strategy is so as outside observers it will be very difficult to really know how well things did or didn‚Äôt go. The best thing for those outside Ukraine to do is to donate to pro Ukrainian funds, call on our elected leaders to send more aid, trust the Ukrainian high command and hype up any and all Ukrainian victories. Support in the west for Ukraine tends to grow when it appears they are winning and drop when it appears that it‚Äôs a stalemate. Setting ridiculously high expectations prior to the offensive can be very counter productive.

   a result of Russia‚Äôs full-scale aggression, 470 children were killed, and another  951 were injured.
  
  at‚Äôs according to an update by the Prosecutor General's Office as of April 27, Ukrinform reports.
  
  s of the morning of April 27, 2023, more than 1,421 children were affected across Ukraine by Russia‚Äôs full-scale armed aggression. According to the official report posted by juvenile prosecutors, 470 children died and more than 951 sustained injuries of various degrees of severity," the statement reads.
  
  ese are not final numbers as data coming from the active combat zones, temporarily captured and liberated territories are yet to be verified.
  
  e largest number of children was affected in the regions of Donetsk (452), Kharkiv (275), Kyiv (127), Kherson (94), Zaporizhia (89), Mykolaiv (88), Chernihiv (68), Luhansk (66), and Dnipropetrovsk (66).
  
   April 27, two 8-year-old girls were wounded as a result of enemy shelling of Mykolaiv.
  
As Ukrinform reported earlier, the European Parliament discussed the issue of the returning Ukrainian children deported to Russia. Their reported number varies from 16,000 to a staggering 300,000.

5207 This is a stupid take. Letting a country into the EU, NATO, whatever should be based on whether or not it is good for the coalition, not whether it's good for the country seeking membership. How on earth does letting Ukraine into the EU right now benefit the EU? It obviously doesn't, it doesn't matter if you support and love Ukraine or not, it's a mess and the EU doesn't need to take on a mess.

Hopefully, those unspecified top Russian officials will fight back. Dissent and actual infighting among the ranks of the Russian leadership is a good thing as they start focusing on protecting their own turf while letting their invasion of Ukraine fall apart from neglect and lack of attention.

5216 The Ukrainians, at great cost, are making the Russians look like fools. Sinking their ships. Destroying their tanks, planes, and artillery fodder.

5225 Am German. We're currently demilitarizing as we're sending so much stuff to Ukraine and buying so little in return.

To quote our defense minister: "Our military is lacking everything."

If you thought that our armies condition was bad before the Ukraine war, then now we've shown how much worse it can be. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5226 Gee, If we could spend all that military money and manpower on providing goods and services in peace-time, we would!

But someone went and tried doing some classic empire-building by occupying its neighbour's land. So now that we are in this position, I don't mind if I have to pay a couple of per cent more in taxes to restore Ukraine's borders and cities. it would be better if we could extract that value from the Russian state; perhaps we should impose "reparations-fees" for any business that is happening in Russia?

I suspect all they want is a ceasefire for a little bit to catch some breath after culminating with their "winter offensive" true lemmings style. Only to break it, blame everyone else and renew their attempts as soon as they get the next mobilization wave done to fill the gaps left by their failed campaign. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5235 As long as it involves Russia retreating to pre 2014 borders including evacuating the Crimea and also giving up members of the their armed forces accused of warcrimes, repatriating Ukrainian POWs and civilians and also paying reparations then‚Ä¶ yeah. That would work.

5241 I think it reflects poorly on the U.S. that China is the one attempting to broker peace talks. Especially after the allegations earlier this year that U.S. stalled out peace talks.

Interesting situation for him to be in, both U.S. and China clearly have their own ulterior motives for involving themselves in this conflict.

> On April 11, Prigozhin said more than 80 percent of Bakhmut was controlled by his Wagner forces, which Ukraine has denied.

> Russia says capturing Bakhmut would allow its troops to mount further offensives in eastern Ukraine, but Western analysts say the city&#039;s fall would not mark a significant victory for Moscow.

5262 Russia is in a uniquely precarious position with its over extension in Ukraine. The recent rise in oppositional Private Military Companies offers an interesting opportunity to raise a coup d‚Äô√©tat internally. Russia‚Äôs traditional armed forces are over extended, and factions within Russia may seize on the opportunity to wipe out Putin. When better to make a move than during a full on offensive that has the Russian military and security forces completely preoccupied? For the sake of all of the younger generations being slaughtered by this fools errand, hopefully the madness ends soon. Slava Ukraini!!!!

This was a wrong policy that was misinterpreted by the aggressor and led to a major war in Europe.

5269 ‚ö°Ô∏èA bipartisan draft resolution entitled "Victory of Ukraine" was submitted to the House of Representatives of the US Congress.

Ukraine's victory is considered to be the return of Kyiv under the control of Ukraine within the internationally recognized borders of 1991.

The draft states that "the world that will bring victory to Ukraine must be ensured by Ukraine's integration into NATO." The US "must work with its allies and partners to ensure that Russia pays reparations to Ukraine and that the international community helps rebuild Ukraine."

>Another leaked document, dated February 28th and reviewed by

>There have been several warnings about Russia's attempts to intervene in Moldova's internal politics. On February 13th, Moldova's President, 
@sandumaiamd
, directly accused Russia of attempting to overthrow the pro-EU government.

>On March 12th, Moldovan police announced that they had foiled a plot by groups of Russian-backed actors who were specially trained to cause mass unrest during a protest against the country's new government (also pro-Western).

>A few days before the protests erupted, Moldovan police arrested a man, claiming that he was a member of Wagner PMC and presenting photos of his tattoos as evidence.

>The leaked US MoD document states that in February, the head of the Russian PMC "Vegacy Strategic Services" coordinated with an employee of a Wagner-linked group called "The Farm" (probably "The Troll's Farm") to adjust their planning for destabilization activities in Moldova. 

>The PMC known as "Vegacy" (formerly "Vega") is well-known and has been investigated for its links to Wagner. @ServiceSsu even claimed that "Vegacy" is merely a cover-up for some of Wagner's operations.

>In the photo taken from the phone of the "Wagner guy" who was arrested in Moldova on March 9th (first tweet in this thread), we can see people wearing Wagner medals, and one of them wearing a patch that looks similar to the one used by the "Vegacy" (not 100% sure).

>According to the leaked Pentagon document, the organizers of the Moldovan protests had planned to train protesters in Turkey from February 24th to 28th, but changed the location to a training center in Russia due to "Turkish intelligence's attention on Russian males. 

>They also extended the total training time to one or two months. More than 150 protesters were supposed to attend the training, which included lessons on starting protests, security service reactions to riots, first aid, and training on what to do if caught.

5280 [This is a fantastic article with interviews from insiders of Putin's inner circle on how his views of Ukraine evolved, all the way from before 2004, until he made the final decision for war in 2021.](https://verstka-media.translate.goog/kak-putin-pridumal-voynu?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp) It's a long read, but it's worth it. I hope someone does a proper translation.

"Putin really believed that it was possible to change the regime in Kyiv quickly and painlessly. Kovalchuk convinced him that the West was weak; Medvedchuk, that Ukraine is weak and loyal."

also on Putin's first meeting with Zelensky, who he believed would be easy to out-maneuver and impose the Russian version of the Minsk agreements (that would have led to the dissolution of Ukraine):

"In December 2019, Putin went to Paris in full confidence that the long-standing issue would move. However, as it turned out, Zelensky was an even more difficult negotiator than his predecessor [...] ‚ÄúPutin, who came down from the mountain to accept the surrender of Ukraine, in fact turned out to be in the role of an abandoned bride [...] Putin's arrival in Paris was a colossal mistake by the Russian president, who overestimated the unpreparedness of Zelensky and his team. From the great tsar of all Rus', Putin has become almost a laughingstock."

5284 Russian Wagner PMC founder Prigozhin:

Ukrainian Army go on a counteroffensive after May 2.

They are ready to cut our flanks. There is a betrayal inside Russia. They don't give us ammunition. We still have enough for two or three weeks.

5287 Every day, Prigozhin comes up with a new mood for himself, anywhere between victorious and defeatist. Today, he's once again hysterical: in a 5-minute audio rant he declares that the Ukrainian offensive is inevitable, will start after 2nd May when the soil dries up, and that Wagner will last 2-3 more weeks in the current conditions.

He goes on to accuse the military of holding up ammunition (again) which results in a 5-time increase in casualties among the mercenaries. Prigozhin says those responsible will be answering before the family members of mobiks who will suffer when the AFU start moving.

The transcription of the audio recording is below.

5291 I know Ukrainian and Russian are different languages but i was curious to see just what the differences are. This was a really good article: https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/differences-russian-ukrainian

I was surprised at how far the differences go back, basically to the origins of Russia itself. And this bit was very well put: 
> As already stated, Russian and Ukrainian are separate languages. Any remaining debate over the fact is not really about vocabulary and alphabets. Throughout history, language has been a way for groups to form identity and rally around a cause. There‚Äôs no scientific way to prove that two languages are separate, so people can play up or play down differences to suit a certain narrative. When someone equates Russian and Ukrainian ‚Äî particularly given the situation today ‚Äî it‚Äôs not rooted in linguistic fact, it‚Äôs an argument about nationhood.

5297 Ukraine prepares priority action plan for liberated Crimea ‚Äì President's representative in Crimea 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
5298 it's good they're taking steps in advance to handle Crimea.

ignoring the fact that taking Crimea is going to be a gargantuan undertaking and the supplies sent so far won't cut it. Ukraine needs more tanks and access to Western fighter jets.

there's still the difficult job of deciding what to do with the Russians living in Crimea. do they deport them or let them stay? it's going to be a huge hurdle for Ukraine to not look bad if Russian civilians in Crimea refuse to leave. letting them stay might open a security risk and cracking down on them will make Ukraine looks authoritarian, deporting them forcefully will make them even more brutish.

Slava Ukraini! 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5301 Crimea is like a natural fortress. There is no way to take it with out mass casualties. It's nearly an island and barely connected to the Ukrainian mainland by the Isthmus of Perekop. This area is, if I remember correctly hardly 4 km wide and is a natural choke point which is the ONLY way to get a marching army into Crimea by land. Russia has been fortifying it since 2014 with land mines and artillery. Marching into Crimea requires soldiers to line up in a row and get picked off like tin cans.

Slightly to the east is a swamp called the Syvash. It is between .5 and 1 meter deep during low tide. It's ballsy but you could go across and flank them but then the tide would come in and you'd be trapped unable to retreat. Also this means there would be no supply line, which is also very bad. The Syvash is not a good option unless you are tired of living.

Historically, taking Crimea requires significantly more man power than the defender (at *least* 4x) and takes casualties that are upwards up to 5 to 1. Right now, Russia has *least* 35K people. We know this because of that piece of shit that leaked all that intel. To have a hope of taking Crimea, Ukraine will need 70,000 men and to have a good chance they will need to attack with 140,000 men. Most of these people will die.

It would be better to destroy that ugly bridge. Don't allow anyone or anything in and only allow people to leave. They can pour cement in the aqueduct in the north and just make life there so brutal and difficult and uncomfortable that most people would just leave willingly.

5317 All Goods and Services to Russian citizens should incur a tax and any goods from a country importing from Russia should be taxed as a percentage of their overall imports from Russia to the nearest percentage.

Russia is liable for the damages inflicted against Ukraine up to whatever threshold Ukraine can demonstrate that Russia is liable for. 

The frozen Russian assets will be a large down payment toward the debt but many hundreds of billions are still owed.

5322 Make it a direct contribution to the Ukrainian armed forces so that Russians have to commit treason to leave. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5323 My idea is this. Since Russia won't agree  to reparations, all countries for Ukraine should add an import tax on Russian imports, maybe 10 percent. This goes to Ukraine. The tax will stop being imposed when a defined sum of reparations is paid.

Probably needs some more rules, and maybe a processing fee for the importing country, and other stuff. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5324 Charging this fee would effectively be closing the border to anyone required to pay the fee, for the following reason:

Suppose this is adopted by a random EU country, let's pick France.

French government:  You need a visa to cross the border.  To get the visa, you have to pay a ‚Ç¨20 fee to help Ukraine.

Russian government:  We shoot all the Nazis.  The leaders of Ukraine are Nazis.  Anyone who helps the Nazis is a Nazi.

Any random civilian thinking about crossing the border:  If I don't pay the fee, I won't have a visa and the French won't let me in or out.  If I do pay the fee, the Russians will call me a Nazi and shoot me.  I guess this means I'm stuck on whichever side of the border I'm currently on.

5378 Sure, sure.....Poland is going to take its historic part of western Ukraine back (with the beautiful but decaying city of Lwow) and in return it will get the most anti-Polish/nationalist Ukrainian population within its new borders.

5383 I think Putin and Medvedev are both actually saying exactly what they want to have happen, kind of juxtaposed.

Putin is saying we will fight and win at all costs. 

Medvedev says that the way to peace is neuter and disarm Ukraine.

This is the Russian mindset, even in their version of the reasonable alternative, they will not entertain an outcome that involves stepping back from the precipice.  Either the West destroys Ukraine with diplomacy, or Russia does it with steel.

5384 So this is the peace plan? Split up Ukraine, give bits to its neighbours, and then Ukraine will no longer exist. And the speech peppered with nuclear threats too. 


Both disturbing and terrifying at the same time - insofar some sort of cessation to war will have to happen sometime in the short or long term, and people will need to negotiate with these absolute fuckers to get it.

5390 Weird source, here's the full quote from the briefing via the [US State Department site.](https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-april-25-2023/)


> MR PATEL: Got it. So, I think an important thing to remember here ‚Äì and I spoke about this a little bit last week ‚Äì is that there is one country here trying to erase the borders of another. That is Russia. Russia is unlawfully, unjustly aggressing against Ukraine, against Ukraine‚Äôs territorial integrity and sovereignty. And so, what the United States is going to do is continue to support our Ukrainian partners through humanitarian assistance, through security assistance, through energy assistance ‚Äì and we‚Äôre going to continue to hold the Russian Federation accountable through the ways that we have done ‚Äì through sanctions, through export controls.
> 
> On the purchase ‚Äì Pakistan‚Äôs purchase of Russian energy ‚Äì look, each country is going to make its own sovereign decisions as it relates to its energy supply. One of the reasons that the United States, through the G7, has been a big proponent of the price cap is to ensure that steps are not being taken to keep Russian energy off the market because we understand that there is a demand for supply. But we also need to take steps to ensure that Russians ‚Äì Russian energy markets are not turning out to be a windfall for Putin‚Äôs war machine. And so, again, countries will make their own sovereign decisions. We have never tried to keep Russian energy off the market.

I wouldn't call that a defense of anything, more of a shrug and not giving a crap about what Pakistan does, or the amount of money they can bring to bear.

The article posted by OP is just a snippet of that quote and some mediocre "journalism" on a Pakistani site.

5406 Ukraine preparing "priority measures" following liberation of Crimea 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
5407 It‚Äôs always good to be prepared both for the best and worst case scenarios. Crimea is part of Ukraine so it makes sense that the Ukrainian government would want to ensure things go smoothly after liberation and that requires planning.

 There may also be a military aspect to this as well and perhaps if Russia thinks the counter offensive is going to be towards Crimea they may redeploy some of their troops from the Donbas there. Either way nothing is lost by planning. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5408 Ukraine talks so much about capturing Crimea that I'm thinking it's done to mislead Russia. This way Russia will focus more of their defenses in Crimea, thinking that there might be a large push, especially in the area around Kherson.

Meanwhile other defenses would obviously weaken as Russia transfers troops away from there, allowing Ukraine to more easily accomplish their counter offensive.

Lula doesn't speak English so you are usually seeing his words being translated and sometimes things get lost.

He doesn't blame Ukraine for the war. He condemns the invasion. But he said that Russia felt threatened by NATO and invaded. He is not saying Russia is right, just their reasoning, even if it's a flawed reasoning.

5419 The scale of this war is kind of boggling.  The amount of equipment, ammunition and personnel lost daily is utterly unsustainable.   It's like the entire military output **and stockpiles of decades of production** of the entire world being split between two countries and they're burning through it faster than the entire worlds production can keep up.  

Russia has lost **three times** as many soldiers in Ukraine as the US lost on Vietnam in **1/6th** of the time.  In other words, it's almost 20x as deadly of a war.  Ukraine's losses probably aren't much better. Even with the rosier estimates they've still lost as many people as the US lost in Vietnam.

They've spent about a third of their losses in Bahkmut (one Vietnam's worth of deaths) and have only captured an area the size of 4 mile by 4 mile square.    That's like 6 dead soldiers per acre. Think about a typical half-acre house lot--3 dead soldiers just to capture one house worth of territory.  

It's crazy and unsustainable.

Thanks to our caring citizens, we received, among other things, information about the enemy.¬†Often risking their own lives, they adjusted the fire of our artillery.

5434 Ukraine to launch spring counteroffensive 'soon' - but first a battle for Kherson.

Ukraine is likely to launch a counteroffensive soon, with one of its main goals to break through a southern land corridor between Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimea region, military analysts have said.

An important step in achieving this would be retaking all the Kherson region. 

It currently only holds the south.

To help achieve this, Ukrainian forces based on the western side of the Dnipro River said they were frequently carrying out raids on the eastern bank near the city in an effort to dislodge Russian troops.

Russian forces have held all territory east of the Dnipro since November, but Yuriy Sobolevskyy, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration, said today that the Ukrainian armed forces were working "very effectively" together.

"Our military visit the left (eastern) bank very often, conducting raids. The Ukrainian armed forces are working, and working very effectively," Mr Sobolevskyy told Ukrainian television.

"The results will come as they did on the right bank of the Kherson region when, thanks to a complex and long operation, they were able to liberate our territories with minimal losses for our military. 

"The same thing happens now on the left bank."

5447 Does anyone think the war will be over in under two years, and if so, what series of events do you think will occur that will enable the war to end in under two years?

It seems impossible to have any confidence in the likely outcome because so much depends on countries that aren't even directly fighting.  Does China supply Russia with thousands of vehicles or join sanctions followed by India against Russia (neither seems likely).  Does US support for Ukraine suddenly disappear or does the US get semi serious about supporting Ukraine and give them more than <1% of their stuff - maybe something like 20+ F16s (over 4k made) and thousands of JASSMs (370km range so only a few could destroy the Crimean bridge) and other munitions (this doesn't seem likely either).

5450 Something to consider is that virtually every aspect of Russia is going to be negatively propagandized about in the West, even things which have nothing to do with the current conflict. Likewise, everything about the West and Ukraine is going to be negatively propagandized in Russia. One example of this is the Wikipedia article about the [Russo-Georgian war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War). Compare the current version of the article to one from [January 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russo-Georgian_War&oldid=265457069) and you can see just how much it's been packed with anti-Russian propaganda. Organizations can claim to be neutral all they want, but unless you know for certain the people running and working for them don't have any conflicts of interest, assume they're lying.

5451 I said it a few times already but man, the pravda.ua comments section is gold.  
[Ukraine's Defence Minister believes expectations from counteroffensive "somewhat overheated"](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/04/27/7399641/)

Some highlights: 

I.K: Wasn't Resnikov himself together with OPOYA, Budanov "overheating" expectations with his public statements?

O.B: And who is spinning all this? Our media with the help of some experts.

O.P: "Overheated"? It's actually the government that keeps talking about an offensive all the time.

A.K: Yeah, you could say it differently, there won't be any pronounced offensive... and maybe fewer people will be killed.

O. C.: Advancing without weapons means a lot of bloodshed. So let's see. There's no need to rush. We can postpone it until next year if we don't have all the weapon samples. 

G.B: For a successful offensive, total mobilization is needed, everyone who can hold a weapon, including women (like in Israel). Considering the sluggish supply of weapons, that's the only chance for victory. 

And in response:

D.D: What's the point????? If we just throw bodies to the front, sorry for the expression, there will be much more of them in Russia!!! Ukraine is primarily about people, not just a piece of land.

I wonder how many bots will rush to criticize this post where nothing is mentioned about the "brightest" one?

E.K: At the end of winter, the chief of casual genre, Kyrylo Budanov, predicted the capture of Crimea before summer, with a map dividing Ukraine... Now the egg-and-cabbage minister is saying that someone is "overheating." Mr. Minister, it's not enough to listen to your mother, you also need to think for yourself... 

I could copy all of them, but the most upvoted ones are just variations of what I.K. said. I wonder when pro-Ukrainians in this subreddit will start sounding like actual Ukrainians and not like the propaganda bots that these Ukrainians have  ironically called out in that comment section.

5452 It has now been about 5 weeks since the last Russian missile barrage. 

The Infrastructure campaign has been a resounding failure. Ukraine's electricity grid has weathered the storm.  

The [Kaliber that wouldn't stop according to Russian MoD](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlIladhX0AAUwT0.jpg:large), has now, indeed stopped. Or at the very least, slowed down dramatically. 

Running out of missile, is not a meme, we've told you again and again, it was a simple case of an unsustainable use of missiles, stockpiles are not endless. 

Now I am left wondering, they are of course building new missiles all the time, are they stockpiling these newly built missiles to use these in another missile barrage on the infrastructure? Or are they planning to use them in a more tactical way against the Ukrainian counter offensive?

What a great way to divert attention from the outrage caused by forced conscription. Those (military commissars) people are the ones currently disliked within Ukraine. Nonetheless, I believe this is just smoke and mirrors and will likely remain as a mere recommendation.

5454 Most of the discussion regarding the NATO document leak devolved into arguments regarding doctored KIA numbers.  Aside from that, the overwhelming majority of pro Ukrainians concluded that the documents are disinformation, perhaps to throw off the Russians as to where exactly will be the focal point of the offensive. 

But the reality is that it could very well be an actual leak in which case the Russian MOD has gained significant insights not just into the battle plans but troop organization, training numbers, and weapon and ammunition details.   Suffice it to say, that is a treasurer trove of intelligence that can alter the course of the war.

Without once again devolving into arguments over whether it is real or misinformation, how does Ukraine now adapt to this leak if it is, in fact, real?  Do they continue on with the offensive as planned despite tipping their hand?  Do they reorganize it around a different focal point?  Do they call it off entirely and simply bolster weak points in their front line with the newly trained troops and equipment?

Recent post by pro Ukraine account which further proves that Ukraine does not rotate its soldiers. I first heard of this by historylegends quoting a western volunteer who stated the fact Ukraine did not rotate soldiers. I was skeptical because it would be a very unproductive strategy or at least showing a total breakdown of organized combat.

Not sure how all the NATO training is going if they can't even adapt this basic concept. Are they actually training commanders or just front line soldiers?

There was also a recent video where ukranian soldiers recovering the dead stated "it was his first day" which would also imply that Ukraine is just sending in reinforcements to fight with units they don't know and never trained with . What an absolute shit show. Yet many pro Ukrainians still think more Russians are dying in Bakhmut

5462 People seem to forget that the whole "Ukraine will run out of AA in April" story is based on the scenario that Kiev recieves no further ammunition or systems from the rest of the world and that Russia was able to upkeep their attack waves over the last few months. According to the same information, Ukraine has already run out of SA-11, SA-8, IRIS-T, NASAM and will run out of SA-10 missiles tomorrow. Which would mean that most of the S-300 fleet would be useless for Ukraine. Guess they weren't much of a loss then, eh?

Also it's kinda crazy to think that we all only talk about this due to the leaks. There was no indication or speculation about this before.

I think most americans are very oblivious to how arm twisting the US is for winning this war in Ukraine. They have blackmailed and arm twisted almost every country imaginable. Germany at first refused to send any arms and then did so after Biden landed there.


Most countries are now extremely pissed off at the US and the resentment is building as the war drags on. The US is on a suicide path but it's blinded by it's hatred of Russia.

It was created for, among other things, the users who feel the need to voice their opinions on how they feel about the subreddit (e.g., the constant comments about "please do something about pro-Ukraine brigading").

Attacking other users is not welcome in this subreddit. Rule 1 is still by far the most common reason people get banned for toxic comments.

5474 How do you guys think Wagner will affect international wars after the Ukraine conflict ends? To my knowledge, there's never been a private military company of this size anywhere else in the world before. Once the war in Ukraine ends, almost any country in the world could have a 40,000-strong trained and capable armed force at their beck and call if they're willing to pay. You can imagine how that could influence wars in places like Myanmar, Syria, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Armenia/Azerbaijan, Sudan, and any number of other places. It could be that almost every military conflict in the world will have Wagner fighters fighting for one side or the other in a few years.

5475 Kind of a tough take, but how do you all think this war will end?

I mean, considering the state of war right now - Russia is more than capable to keep this going on for very long, but it's already neck-deep in this with defeat being unacceptable (apparently Mr. Putin is more likely to nuke the world than let the Russia lose) and Ukraine is in ruins and surviving on western military aid life support. Speaking of which, US and NATO are now knee-deep in this as well, as their reputation is somewhat at stake. If Ukraine is defeated, then all that aid and money was spent in vain. Then there is China sitting somewhere in the back eating popcorn and eyeing Taiwan with unclear goals. 

I'm kinda intrigued by how it will go, but terrified at same time.

5481 What's the state of discussion around the war on your country's subreddit?

r/hungary is rather abysmal, it started out good when we had a megathread in the first few weeks with actual constructive discussion, then the mods shut it down and they let a guy make daily propaganda posts to "inform" people. It's been months of 1:10 k/d ratio, shovels, human wave attacks, Russia losing 2k+ soldiers a day, all the low effort propaganda coupled with presenting tweets with 6 views as a legitimate source of news (despite getting debunked in like 2 hours).

People eat it up and think that's reality. The ones who call out the guy or present evidence against it get brigaded and often banned by the mods. My favorite is that the mods let people call Russians "orcs" and "genetically inferior scum" on a regular basis but when I called someone "dumb" for trusting the guy I got a 5 day ban for going too far lol. Now nobody bothers to argue with them, it's just a full on echochamber.

Cherry on top, mods replaced the sub banner with a flag of Ukraine a year ago, there were repeated calls to revert it back (especially since Ukraine is ramping up its anti-minority policies which affects our diaspora too) but those people got banned too.

5484 I seriously don't get why some Pro UA claim Russia is having more calculaties in bakhmut, I mean sure at the beginning and in soledar? I can believe it. Now? When they are less then 2km from the Russian in every direction except west? Hell nah.


But in no fucking universe Ukrainians surrounded by Three side with no clear supply line is killing more Russians while in their own words, Russia is firing at least √ó4 of artillery in to the city, the only supply route is a dirt road which is only 2km away from each side, the amount of drones, artillery shells and even mortals going to that place is unimaginable. 


Ukraine can support its troops to at least survive due to the nature of urban warfare, which doesn't require much heavy equipment and thus supplying the forces is possible even if half the truck that go through that dirt road don't make it, a single truck passing can have thousands of magazines for the defenders.


But I mean look at the fucking city, Ukraine is burning through its manpower with absolutely no advantage other than concentrating Russian forces in onc place because when the counter offensives starts they cannot easily relocate their forces from bakhmut, but Ukraine also has high concentration of forces in that area so it doesn't make sense.

5486 Question for pro-Ukrainians: how do you justify abducting people and forcing them to fight?

There are by now very many videos of Ukrainians being abducted from streets and other public places by the Kiev regime. These are not widely reported by Western media, but I don't see any widespread attempt to claim that the videos are not real and are Russian propaganda. I know there are many examples of countries at war legally requiring citizens to fight, and punishing whoever refuses. But military recruiters abducting people off the street does not seem normal, and seems like something some evil organization would do.

Personally I think it'll be the most pivotal event of the war. If they don't capture cities like Melitopol and Berdyansk, then it's an unequivocal failure.

Ukrainian government officials will of course say they just need more equipment and support to finish the job. They'll only receive a cold shoulder.

5491 The level of propaganda on r/Ukraine is insane. 

They actively cultivate a narrative that pro Russia is insane and then pushing only the pro UA narrative. 

For example, in the explosion story, immediately after the explosion there was mixed responses. 

There was one comment that caught my attention that mentioned that they lived nearby the town and confirmed there is an ammo depot in the area. 

Visiting the same post after a few hours. 

All the comments have been sanitized and all the upvoted comments are inline with the narrative. No alternative view points. 

The interesting thing is that the comment from the Ukrainian confirming there is an ammo depot has been hard deleted. 

But interestingly, insane and inflammatory pro Ru comments that are downvoted aren‚Äôt deleted. They keep them there to give the sub appearance of balance and open discussion.

5493 [Ukraine has risen sharply in the rating of press freedom](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2023/05/3/7400442/)

I know for some people it might look like I am totally anti-ukraine on the surface because when I com 

I understand that some people may perceive me as being anti-Ukraine due to my previous unfavorable comments. However, I specifically choose to express my views here because it allows for open discussion. It's important to note that only about 1/10 of my comments are critical of Ukraine.

That being said, I find the situation rather disheartening. I have always had faith in institutions, believing that they are more knowledgeable and significant than myself. However, this ongoing war has opened my eyes to certain aspects that I would have otherwise overlooked.

I am open to having my opinions challenged and I welcome counterarguments. Nevertheless, I am genuinely confused about how the current rating of press freedom in Ukraine is even remotely possible. Let me clarify that I do appreciate the Ukrainian media landscape. I find newspapers such as "Ukrainska Pravda" and "Radio Svoboda" to be exceptional sources of news and information, at least in terms of their own articles and publications. Although the later  receives government funding from the US, itheir articles are still top notch.

However, it is evident that press freedom has been significantly affected by the war. Laws have been enacted, imposing substantial restrictions on what can be published, especially concerning the war. Even at face value, claims like "a decrease in oligarchs' influence on journalism" are only true on the surface. This reduction in influence was not due to government actions taken to curb their power. The oligarchs have simply taken a temporary step back and adopted a low-profile approach, given the immense power of President Zelensky and his government at present. They continue to exert their influence through their foundations, attempting to maintain a positive public image. It's merely a temporary situation, and as one person, I am incapable of delving into the complexities of these issues. However, it does give rise to a clear bias towards Ukraine. While it may be beneficial for Ukraine, it significantly affects their reputation in my eyes. I understand that most people won't share my perspective, but it is disheartening to witness.

Furthermore, if one were to argue that these measures are proportional to the ongoing war, it would be worth noting that Ukraine has been involved in this conflict for eight years, even if not on a full-scale basis. Ukraine itself emphasizes that it dislikes drawing a distinction in this regard. Additionally, there are multiple other countries engaged in wars, yet they do not experience a similar boost in their press freedom ratings.

Pretty weak imo

5495 Earlier today, I posted about [Ukraine's plans to build a new bridge named "Azovstal" for Kyiv's Recreation Area.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/12qno1b/ua_pov_azovstal_pedestrian_bridge_for_kyivs/) The project is funded by France and is being constructed by SCM, which is Ukraine's leading oligarch's company.

I was questioned on why I posted that.

In my opinion, this is relevant to the war in Ukraine because it involves the city of Paris, as they are providing funding for the bridge. More so major Ukrainian politicians and Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's biggest oligarch, are also involved. The whole situation appears to be tainted with corruption from the very first day the project was started.

When viewed from a Ukrainian perspective, it raises questions as to why resources are being directed towards building an entertainment park and bridges when there is an ongoing war. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5496 I want to provide here my views on this war and to discuss it with others, so feel free to debate me if you agree or disagree with something.

**Situation of Ukraine**

Ukraine has several advantages and disadvantages in this war. Ukrainians see this war as a war against invaders and that their duty is to defend their land. This gives Ukrainians very high boost to people wanting to fight for Ukraine, even attracting foreign ex-soldiers. On the other hand, Ukraine has only 40 million people contrary to Russia's 120 milion.

Equipment in Ukraine is moreless plentiful. All soldiers in combat have armor, modern weapons, helmets,... provided by West. All of ukrainian soldiers have training mainly done by western instructors. Also Ukraine has many weapons to deal with many russian soldiers or military vehicles, such as drones operated by skilled pilots, starstreak against enemy aircraft, javelins and other anti-tank weapons.

Vehicles are limited for Ukraine as Ukraine gets only what West sends them. Despite this, Ukraine gets modern military vehicles, which should be very high quality. Western countries have also sent a lot of their old soviet weaponry to 'empty their storage'. Ukraine would certainly liked to have more of them but that is question of another paragraph.

The West. West is supporting Ukraine, which is HUGE advantage for it. Western people are interested in this conflict, many people in the West consider Ukraine to be righteous defender and so the westerners are pushing their politicians to send aid to Ukraine. This support was thought to be drying up as Ukraine feared westerners would get bored of the conflict. This did not happen mainly because of reports of ukrainian civilian deaths, like Bucha, Irpin and other rocket attacks which hit civilian buildings. The western support is not drying up and not everything West sends get to be in the news, like trucks for military and other more technical stuff sent.

The West is suffering from one problem - underfinanced arms industry. In the previous years, western countries didn't spend 2 % of their budget for defense and this resulted in arms industry being completely unprepared for such a production increase needed, like with artillery ammo, which is another topic in another paragraph. But this problem is slowly but surely resolved via free market as the more buying of weaponry and vehicles results in arms industry having huge profits, which are invested into increase of production. Also the arms industry does not have to worry about not having costumers in next years because West will buy arms like crazy in this time.

Support of West is not just about sending military stuff, West provides Ukraine with satelite pictures greatly helping to adjust ukrainian army strategies. Western generals can be consulted if situation demands it and there are as mentioned before western instructors in Ukraine and ukrainian mobilised men can get training in the West. West is also sending money to Ukraine, which makes Ukraine basicaly immune to financial attrition in the war.

Western support is not just official one but rather also help directly from the civilians as many civilians are donating money to groups that are buying stuff for ukrainian army and civilians. 

Ammo is weakness of Ukraine. Ukraine needs much more artillery ammo for its operations and West has almost emptied its reserves. New ammo can only be sent or it might be good idea to look elsewhere, like f.x. to Pakistan, but such ammo can be worse quality. Less shots by artillery are problem for ukrainian army as the artillery is considered very huge factor in the war.

Air support is another weaknes of Ukraine as Ukraine had only old MIGs at the start of the war plus some helicopters. While Ukraine got another stuff, it is still not the F-16s Ukraine wanted.

**Situation of Russia**

Russia is in a different state than Ukraine. Russia benefits from having a certain level of militarization in society, which gives Russia a certain basal garanteed level of societal stability. Russia is greatly suffering from internal corruption (also present in Ukraine but much less and is slowly being decreased even now during war). This corruption is so high russian officials are even building fortifications f.x. in Kursk region to pocket money, even during the war. On the other hand, this corruption also helps Russia maintain it's rule as the official who are doing the corruption are loyal to russian government no matter what.

Nevertheless the corruption has made it's huge mark in army. At the start of the war, many russian tanks stopped moving because fuel ran out because soldiers simply sold the fuel while waiting in Belarus for 'end of training'. Corruption also resulted in russian tanks needing more time for repair because soldiers in storage also sold electronics inside the tanks.

Big problem for Russia is also the budget deficit. War is expensive and Russia must pay all of it's expenses from it's own money. While the western sanctions did not brought Russia on it's knees, it certainly made russian budget income smaller as Russia had to look for buyers to it's oil and gas elsewhere. India and Russia buys russian gas but with discount, so there is not much of a profit there.

Russia has three times larger population with greated potential for mobilisation. But Russia must be careful with such mobilisations because they result in less workers in economy, which is huge weakness for Russia. Mobilised men are often sent to war unprepared or just with minimal training and this is a problem for combat, where this greatly reduces combat efectiveness. Also using a lot of infantry soldiers is problematic for morale as great loss of infantry life can result in surviving soldiers rejecting to go back to fight.

Russia's greatest advantage is it's HUGE army storage. Many weapons, many vehicles. Although the vehicles are often old and rusted due to being decades unused and stored. This pool of vehicles is not bottomless and right now Russia sends even the T-55s to the front or the 'Frankenstein' vehicles. Nevertheless, Russia still has large reserves.

Also Russia's advantage is air support as Russia has large number of planes and helicopters to use in the war. But the starstreak systems has evened the odds here so most of the time bombers are dropping glide bombs from afar rather than drop bombs directly or close above the ukrainian army. 

Russia also keeps getting better at the war and changing it's strategies since the start of the conflict, where Russia was very ineffective, such as in Kyiv military vehicle convoy, where 32 km convoy was stopped due to some vehicles breaking down. Russia is using now Lancets much more frequently, which are considered very successful, although it is question about how much of the lancet videos are real targets and how much are decoys.

Russia relies on the Wagner PMC and this relationship has not been always optimal. Prigozhin sometimes called russian army leadership incompetent and complained he did not received ammo. And while the Bakhmut battle seems to be coming to it's end, Wagner and russian army still were not able to conquer all of it.

Russia and it's allies are much more complicated. While Iran is sending Shaheeds and probably other stuff to Russia, this is not enough for Russia to change battlefield. China and Russia are allies, but China still seems to act neutraly with a little bit leaning towards Russia. One can speculate about reasons for it. Recent Xi's visit to Moscow has not brought any significant aid to Russia. 

So I'll wrap it here, there is a lot of points one can talk about but this should be enough. When I look at all of this, I believe the war still can't be decided to who will win. Although what I see is that Ukraine has more advantages for war going long-term unless Russia significantly increases it's combat effectivity, which can tip the scales to Russia's side.

5498 Bakhmut is a total disaster for Ukraine. People who don't accept this are in denial. They are actually getting crushed so badly that it's not even funny. The last defenders are getting pinned in the west of the city by Wagner and are getting FAB bombed to hell. The roads are cut.

5504 People don't understand that Prigozhin's speeches and antics are mostly for internal Wagner consumption.   These guys have been assaulting one of the most fortified Ukrainian cities for six months.  The reason their morale is so high has a lot to do with Prigozhin's bombastic personality.   I mean, if this is how he acts on camera, imagine how he is off camera.  

None of this stuff is to be taken literally.  Do you think he'd still be alive with all the stuff he has pulled if Putin was upset with him?  He'd be lanceted in a hurry if he was.  

There's a significant amount of deception taking place on both sides right now.  The Ukrainians are attempting to confuse the Russians with regards to where they will begin their offensive, and the Russians are attempting to bait the Ukrainians into trying to recapture Bakhmut. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5505 The comments in this thread are bit puzzling. And from both sides. It sounds like most people are missing the point.

Wagner is spent but it served its purpose for Russia. They were always expendable. The regular mercenary contractors less so than the convicts. But both were disposable. That was the whole point of using them in the first place. Have them do the dirty work.

How much of Bakhmut remains in Ukrainian's hands? 10%? Wagner troops will just be replaced by regular Russian army soldiers who will probably finish the job sooner or later.

Wagner probably needs to pull back so as to retain a cadre of experienced troops before they're completely wiped out so Prigozhin can rebuild his private army and go commit war crimes elsewhere. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5506 "But the battle of bakhmut was a huge Ukrainian L!"

Well, I think that the whole "10 Ukrainians killed for each Russian" was a fucking lie and the opposite was the and is the most probable. I mean, the moment Wagner stopped recruiting at prisons because nobody would accept, OR, there weren't that much of prisoners left, was a huge red flag. But pro-Russians do not live in our reality, they live in a world where the defeats of Kyiv, Kherson, Sumy and Kharkiv were actually well made traps for the Ukrainians to not defend the south.

If people have this mentality, they will surely ignore any sign of a Russian massacre in Bakhmut. Oh well, glad to see that reality and facts are on the side of people that... Actually believe in reality and facts. I wonder how many "pro-facts" people are going to explain this huge defeat.

Edit: not 10 Russians to each Ukrainian but at least 3 Russians to each Ukrainian. You don't throw a bunch of prisoners at a battle, have them exterminated, and claim that your enemy is having more casualties.

5519 Thank you for the article it was great insite but I can't help but feel like it's a build-up for an excuse to leave the city without capture. They call it the meat grinder, which it was for both sides, used to solely grind down the Ukrainian army yet they continued to try to take the city when he states multiple times that wasn't the objective nor strategically needed.

 Just seems odd to put that out and not a big bravado yes it was operation meat grinder to grind down UA and take the city which is very important to the success of the SMO. 

Side note was it just translation being weird, but why did it switch between Wagner and Vagner? ( I know they are the same, but I would expect it to stay consistent unless they are slightly different within certaincontext)

5524 Girkin's thoughts, curious where he falls on the SBU's list:

-------------------------

>There are practically no doubts that the terrorist attack was carried out by respected Kyiv partners of the Kremlin. In the Russian Federation, Prilepin - in the role of "a clown with pederasts" - did not threaten or interfere with anyone at all. And the "partners" need continuous "victories" for their audience - so that the zombie population of the so-called. "Ukraine" believed in "an early victory." For their propaganda, Prilepin was a "quite iconic" figure, no less caliber than Maxim Fomin (Vladlen Tatarsky).
In addition, frequent terrorist attacks create a feeling of fear, nervousness, etc. in their potential victims. Intimidation of enemies is quite an effective method in the framework of a military confrontation.

> The consequences are likely to be exactly the same as after the attack on the Grand Kremlin Palace by a kamikaze UAV, as well as after the murder of Tatarsky and Daria Dugina. That is, none. Trilateral talks (Russia, "Ukraine" and Turkey) on the transportation of ammonia are scheduled for May 11th. It's sacred...

5536 The thing that makes me think videos like this are faked, is because they're not mentioning names of the people stealing, or the unit they're from. There should be names so something can be done.

If a video like this gets traction, the government will clamp down on the guilty parties. If they're not identified, the only thing that can be drawn from these types of videos, is that they're trying to make Ukraine look bad overall, and not trying to sort out the problem.

Think of all the videos on both sides where the soldiers state their group and commanders who should be looked into, this is what it should be like.

Obviously there is massive corruption on both sides, that is the nature of their cultures for a very long time.

One day, there will simply be too few Western/NATO troops to hold a continuous line of contact. And then them Rooskies will interdict the supply lines of the remaining Western Ukrainian/NATO troops and isolate them into pockets for capture or destruction.

Then them ChiComs step in with a brilliant plan. The plan will be

Why don't they have voting in each Oblask without the Right Sector and Azov from Western Ukraine running the elections in eastern Ukraine? Why not let an eastern Oblask be able to vote on whether or not they want to be or not be part of Ukraine without anyone from the formerly Polish Lithuania Commonwealth half of Ukraine involved in it? 

The only reason the Western Ukrainians rule in Kiev is because Victoria Nuland overthrew the government, and then never let Eastern Ukrainians vote by themselves without interference from Western Ukraine.

5604 Tactically speaking (not symbolically) Ukraine played themselves. They first committed to defense of bakhmut. Then didnt bother to reinforce when wagner got momentum slowly. Now looking how it was about to fall they bring fresh reinforcements to put a stronghold on a small part still controlled by UA. They shouldve reinforced it long before while they had half of the city and flanks.

The problem is that when you have a small budge (thats left in the city) with thick defenses. You will be mauled to death by bombardment. And the more tight your defense. The more damage they do to your perimeter.

And russia (disclaimer,I hate to joke about war) literally smoking them like a cigar with these thermite runs. Hope the remaining civillians (like the babushka in another video) are inside safezones.

Particularly from Prigozhin. But if this is an elaborate scheme you gotta wonder what it‚Äôs doing to the morale of Russian people/troops. 

Maybe lower expectations so when Wagner finally capture Bakhmut it‚Äôs seen as a glorious victory against the odds, rather than an embarrassing consolidation prize after nearly a year of struggle? 

People talk about lulling AFU in to false sense of security/rash attack, but they have the backing of several of the most powerful intelligence apparatus on earth. I doubt they are launching attacks based on public statements from known trolls. 

So if this is all theatre I can‚Äôt seem to find a good reason other than shaping public perception. All very odd.

5620 At a minimum, this is certainly an exercise in expectation control regarding Russian progress in Bakhmut. It sounds like Ukrainian control over the western edge can be expected to continue for who knows how long.

5621 Tactical retreat. Throwaway conscripts will be used on the front now to take the big hits from the ukraine offensive. Shoigu gets the blame for this retreat and possible upcoming failures. Wagner watches from the back until the ukraine offensive loses steam. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5622 Prigozin is making a power grab. He does not want to be associated with any defeats resulting from the Ukraine counter offensive. If any rout and generally chaos occurs the army will be in disarray and having access to loyal fighters he can go for the Kremlin. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5623 Does this seem plausible?

Pull out of Bakhmut before the Ukrainian offensive, force RU forces to plug in the hole, let them grind against the offensive, then come in and claim the glory if the battle is going well or just go somewhere else if it's going poorly.

Just a quick random guess. I'm sure these guys have thought about it a lot more, assuming this is even a real plan at all.

5624 Everything is too perfect. An attack in the Kremlin, Wagnerovites defecting. Maybe they are setting a trap for the emboldened Ukrainians.

5625 Are there estimates anywhere of how many Russian Armed Forces are in Ukraine? From what I've seen Wagner has been fighting the war for them. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5626 I believe there are two things going on 

1) Either he is really not getting the ammo that he wants. Maybe the inner circle is against him getting such a big victory. 

2) He knows the Ukrainian counter attack will be a huge disaster for him and he wants to get his troops to a more defensible position. 

Either way this is not looking good for Russia. If he is not getting enough shells that basically negates the artillery advantage that they supposedly had. 

If he wants to retreat before the counter offensive that means whatever they have controlled is tenuous at best or they think the army will fail and leave their flanks exposed.

5630 Wagner took the majority of Bakhmut, at an enormous cost. It was expected that they would have to take a reduced role on the front after their severe losses. However, one pretty critical analysis I heard today involved Prigozhin's statement about "being there in the future to protect the Russian people."

A unique phrasing that has similarities to the justification of Coup d'etats in other countries. It already can be shown that the admittedly corrupt Russian MOD is harming the Russian people, and it could easily be an act of Patriotism to protect the Russian people from them (really from Putin running Russia into the dirt for his own goals).

It seemed that the Russian MOD was specifically using a withholding of supplies and prisoner recruits to Wagner to cripple Wagner while also inflicting enormous losses for the Ukrainians. Setting up the situation for both of his most major enemies to devastate each other in the bloodiest battle of the war. Shoigu would likely have wanted to complete a more thorough destruction of Wagner before swooping in to finish a victory in Bakhmut.

I predicted that this level of betrayal would result in more serious clashes between Wagner and the Russian MOD. That potentially could lead to clashes in Russia centered around the Wagner bases in St. Petersburg.

Wagner has been the most effective fighting force on the Russian side, and the Russian MOD basically presented an unspoken agreement to the Ukrainians to destroy the majority of Wagner's fighting ability.

The Ukrainian command took the difficult decision to cooperate with the Russians in the near elimination of Wagner, even at the cost of so many killed Ukrainian heroes.

Many people thought that Wagner would retaliate for that betrayal from the Russian MOD, but it is surreal to see that becoming more of an actual possibility.

A civil war in the 2nd most nuclear armed country is a major risk to the entire human race. However, so is an increasingly desperate Genocidal Dictator that could resort to world annihilation to protect his ego from a failing Imperialist invasion.

5641 Exactly the same as with Kherson, Russia was talking about withdrawing while Ukraine insisted it was all a trick and they were actually reinforcing defenses.

I'm actually unconvinced that the result here will be the same but it's interesting nonetheless. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5642 He is either lying or telling the truth.

If he is lying, nothing will change because the Ukrainians won't try a  counteroffensive since the Russian army has been active in the region, more than Wagner in some areas.

If he's telling the truth... Then I guess bakhmut will be relieved for a while and that Russia's problems are way bigger than we thought.

I really don't see that as a "death trap" to the Ukrainians. Wagner goes out, Russian army comes in. Easier to defend, not necessarily easier to attack. Bakhmut also is not that strategical for Ukraine ATM, especially in the current state of the city. If the Ukrainians hold the Russians a little bit longer at bakhmut and manages to break at the South, the Russians may do anything to Bakhmut, Ukraine will see their main objective of the year as accomplished.

Edit: I'm not claiming that Bakhmut is not strategical, it is, but it had more strategic value when it was a city, not a bunch of destroyed buildings. Different participants of the war also have different strategic points. Bakhmut is worth way more to Russia than it is to Ukraine.

5648 Top comment on r/worldnews "Wagner boss says he will pull troops out of Bakhmut"

¬ù


A few months ago, we were wondering why they kept attacking Bakhmut, a city with no strategic value. It was assumed that Prigozhin only wanted to have a victory to show to Putin in a competition with the regular army. Here, he seems to accept that victory is not achievable but proceeds to accuse the regular army of the defeat.

5696 It's good to get the same perspective from the RU side. Both sides have been saying the same thing for a while now, that it makes no military sense for the AFU to keep defending Bakhmut.

Many non-military people (and even some military people) on the UA side are in denial, still clinging to the belief that Bakhmut is a defensible military position.

Here's a [reserve AFU colonel saying essentially the same](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1639024289700618241) as this RU perspective:

>Yes, the perfect strategy: keep your forces trapped in an operative encirclement, continue losing doctors and experienced troops attempting to enter or leave a city located in lowlands, and then use reserves intended for a different offensive to break encirclement, so you can be praised as Bakhmut savior.

When this colonel made this remark, the AFU was probably still using some experience troops.

Appears that AFU doesn't even bother mixing in experienced soldiers so that the units can have at least some combat effectiveness. They're essentially throwing fresh recruits into almost certain death. The AFU is using what's called "individual replacement" which is much derided (for good reason). Someone has defended this policy, but that's within the context of mixing in fresh recruits into a [core of battle hardened soldiers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/11/27/a-few-words-in-favor-of-the-much-derided-individual-replacement-system-for-soldiers/) \-- there's no such core of battle hardened soldiers in this case. The AFU command is doing something only slightly better than literally executing these conscripts on the spot.

There are much [better positions to the west of Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1637924958675386372) to defend. It makes no sense to sit in the city waiting for certain death.

It's also funny to see the UA side defend sending untrained recruits into the front lines. [Responsible armies don't do that](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/11f376d/comment/jak15tg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

5697 High levels of rotation, and using troops with low amounts of investment in them. Just to slow Wagner down and drag them through street fighting and artillery and drone strikes.

Save the highly equipped, trained and motivated troops for the counteroffensive, and give the new troops brief experience on the frontline.

Apart from the disparaging words about Ukrainians, I'm glad to hear this report. Ukraine is acting as it should in Bakhmut. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5698 In the last couple of weeks, there has been an inordinate amount of Dnieper river crossing analysis all over the internet.   There seems to be a growing consensus that, at least in part, the Ukrainians will need to cross the river for this offensive to have any chance of succeeding. 

Personally, I feel this to be a suicide mission. And I don't expect them to go through with it to any large scale.  It will likely only be a small force serving as a diversionary tactic.  

The risk of losing a substantial amount of heavy weaponry to the bottom of the Dnieper is far too great.  An ATGM or FAB 500 strike on this pontoon monstrosity is highly likely.  And since there are unlikely to be any major future deliveries of Western tanks, at least not from Europe, each one will need to be safeguarded from self-inflicted catastrophes. 

The Ukrainians do not have much experience in assualting fortified positions.   Outside of the brief Kherson and Kharkiv offensives,  they have largely been on the defensive this entire war.  It would not make sense for them to increase the complexity of the forthcoming last chance yolo offensive. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5699 The biggest issue is not getting the soldiers across it's defending the supply lines, an FAB blows up a bridge and now Ukrainians are forced to race against time to assemble a logistics force to supply the tanks on the other side of the river. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5700 I think there's a small chance the whole counter offensive was a feint and it never actually happens. Ukraine will use this extra equipment to grind Russia out for years, until the war becomes really unpopular with the Russian public (kind of like the US public with Iraq/Afghanistan). The fsb needs to start thinking about Putins reelection and public perception 

And China's sentiment seems to be shifting as this war drags on. Xi's actually speaking to Zelenskey now and China agreed Russia are the aggressor. Also sanctions will be having a dire effect on the Russian economy in a few years

Not likely, but a small chance

5742 Funnest part of this incident is that people who are justifying incompetence of Ukraine Air defense over Kiev (own drone circled 20 min in day time @ low speed and low altitude) are same ones who believe in official "[We took down all drones and missiles which attacked Kiev in terminal flight stage at night](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/134c6o5/all_russian_missiles_and_drones_which_attacked/)*.*" narrative. No critical thinking skills whatsoever.

Shit happens, who cares. If Russia didn't attack Ukraine, this would not have happened. So just with the missile in Poland, the aggressor is logically to blame.

Russia's Wagner group is LITERALLY founded by a Nazi, & uses Nazi imagery, but yet Russian backers have nothing to say about it. In Ukraine, Azov has zero institutional power, How about Prigozin? He does. Azov holds no political offices.... and they shouldn't. So what is this non-sense about "De-nazification"? In the US, we have Nazi's too unfortunately, even in the armed forces. However, the GOP has gone to bat for them, to prevent them from being banned.... We have white supremacists all over the world.

5790 If Ukraine really wanted to assassinate Putin they would make sure he was there, which he wasn't,  and they would do something a little bigger than something with the destructive power of a firework, aimed at a flagpole.

I don't know if it was a false flag aimed at a home audience,  or an unsophisticated partisan group inside Russia. But we will be able to tell soon, depending on whether this is used inside Russia as an excuse for escalation.  If it is, you'll know the ISW's judgement is correct. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5791 If they staged it, why is Kiev making a sticker celebrating it? 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5792 If Ukraine wanted to try to assassinate Putin, they would definitely not be aiming to blow up Kreml's flagpoles.

If Putin wanted to stage a self-assassination attempt, he would undoubtedly go much bigger than blow up a flag.

Russia is self-owning themselves by shouting out "it was an assassination attempt on Putin!", when this strike is clearly not aimed at any human casualties. (unless Putin is the Hunchback of Notre dame?)

Aiming for a flag on top of Kreml is foremost symbolic, and the timing also is symbolic. Ukraine does not need to gun for such symbolic effects, they have already won the ideological war so many times over due to Russia's own actions, and at this point they do not need to seek for sensational actions to deter Russia from doing something.

To me this reads like a maneuver from a small group of individuals (Russian partisans or Ukrainian non-government people) who wanted to make a symbolic attack against the war or the parade, just to see if they can achieve an effect. Neither government side makes much sense. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5793 I like the ISW's content on this war but this comment seriously makes me doubt their critical thinking or even their bias.

\#1. Putin did not address this at all in Q&A with reporters, you would have thought that if this was to be used for propaganda that they would loudly and immediately start addressing this and using his own narrative. The Russian Govt was also extremely slow to make a statement on this, hinting at confusing and embaressment.

\#2. Images of this attack have not been broadcasted across Russian state TV, again making you wonder, what would be the propaganda point of doing this.

\#3. This attack does nothing but make Russia, and by extension, Putin look weak. This only plays favourable for the anti-war movement and Ukraine. If Putin is under threat in Moscow, everywhere is fair game in Russia which is a massive upset for Russia's power both at home and abroad.

\#4. All the way through this week and even last, nervous jitterings have been sounding all around Russia with parades being scaled back, hinting that they knew this was a possibility.

\#5. Aren't Ukrainians making stickers commemorating this? Weird thing to do when if you had nothing to do with it? Almost points to it being more of a Ukrainian propaganda victory than a Russian which you think that the Russian's would want to limit?

Does anyone have a good source/knowledge how influencial russian politicians thought about Ukraine and Donbas pre invasion?

After the start of the war other russian politicians besides Putin sounded more extreme. Not sure if they are serious or just want to appease Putin.

this is a really big roll of the dice

a.) i doubt ukraine would do this, it is obviously too provocative

b.) small chance that it was a pro-ukraine group in russia, because basically you are going to die afterwards, and not in a good way

c.) it could be a false flag, but why would you do this unless things are going really badly? if you get caught with a false flag attack you lose the war and maybe the country.  if putin authorized it, he is desperate, that seems premature. surely he is not that desperate yet?

d.) if it was done by a russian without his approval, that person is probably dead now. Could it have been Wagner or a higher up trying to spark something?

e.) there will be repercussions from this, because even if it was b.), c.), or d.), putin and russia have to say it was a.), a ukrainian attack.

5838 Could be a false flag attack to create a pre-text for cancelling the May parade.

5869 Such little ziggers like this should go to Ukraine, if they don't like it here. I don't understand why he was not fined. That's a disrespect to people living in Crimea, as many people there has relatives and friends, that were on anti-maidan demos in Kiew / Odessa etc. back in 2014 and was affected by the new nazi regiment. If Russia did not took the Crimea - it would be the same hell as in Donbass. And this shitter understands it, because he runs away immediately after saying that.

5873 Trying to directly kill a president is a grave escalation but not a surprising one considering Ukraine's track record. They had the gall to ask NATO for illegal cluster + phosphorus munitions to use against Russia just a few months a go at the Munich Conference. They demanded *nuclear retaliation* against Russia over a missile on Polish soil that turned out to be Ukranian. 

It is obvious at this point that Zelensky would prefer a global, nuclear holocaust to any actual negotiation over the status of the eastern provinces.

5884 Someone needs to tell people that USA isn‚Äôt deciding what is a fair target. Ukraine would be well within its right to attack Moscow. USA can prohibit then from using US supplied weapons for this purpose if they so choose. But Ukraine ultimately decides. Idk why people keep turning to Blinken as though he is leading the charge here. 

He doesn‚Äôt need to say that US has left it up to Ukraine. He needs to say that it is Ukraines decision. One implies autonomy and the other implies control.

5888 It's ironic that by posting Russian victory videos sane, neutral people gain *more* sympathy for the Ukranian cause.

The fact that defenders have to resort to using WWII-era equipment. Makes me think god damn they will do anything to protect their homeland. By overwhelming everyone with propaganda that the Ukranian army is strong, Russians are stupid, and Russia doesn't have a chance to begin with, it makes people who seek truth get disillusioned with how bs the message is.

Seeing the thermobaric weapon burn soldiers to a crisp and this video is what *actually* makes Russia look like a bully picking on someone who, in the long run, can't really do a thing about the bullying. Pretending Ukraine is and has been stronger than Russia from the start is what makes me roll my eyes and want to see them lose because I am so fucking tired of society being spoonfed "weak is strong" when reality shows otherwise.

5889 Big strategic mistake by the Finns. If they think the Americans will come to the rescue and have their boys killed in order to defend Helsinki then I'm afraid that they're wrong on that.

Even France, Belgium, etc. So having some nazi supporter in Ukraine army means that ALL UAF is nazi? That Zelensky gouvernment is nazi? That all Ukrainian are nazis? 

Is this not a bit too extreme reasonning? Plus, Russia rhetoric is definitely making the cult of the Man. They reject everything about lgbt community with more energy than most of Country in Europe...this mindset was definitely popular among nazism.

So...isn't it weird/contradictory that a country with a single and autoritarian ruler, imposing very strict controls of media, generating a cult of the strong heterosexual man ruling his family, rejecting minorities and using a fierce violence and agression to invade neighbour...

5933 Despite Russian wishes and hopes, western countries not only are not getting tired of helping Ukraine, not only they are not "running out of ammunition", they are actively increasing their aid to reach new peaks. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5934 Armored vehicles that can clear mines, ammunition , field bridges and money for air defense.

It is some military equipment to be sent to Ukraine in a donation package of 1.7 billion. This has been decided by a broad majority in the Danish Parliament .

\- It (the donation package, ed.) means that we help the Ukrainian air defense. It is in demand, says Acting Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen (V) after a meeting in the Foreign Policy Council.

The donation is the largest donation package from Denmark to date and is being sent to support the Ukrainian offensive.

\- It must help to support the capacities that are lacking from the Ukrainian side in order to have a successful offensive now here, which the Ukrainians are planning to recapture the areas that the Russians have occupied, says Troels Lund Poulsen.

\- It is a donation that can hopefully help to ensure that Ukraine gets an even better starting point for becoming master of its own house, he says.

The money comes from the Ukraine fund, which has a framework of [seven billion kroner](https://fm.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2023/marts/regeringen-indgaar-bred-aftale-om-at-etablere-en-milliardstor-ukrainefond-i-2023/) .

The total Danish aid to Ukraine is now up to DKK 11 billion.

## Battalion in Latvia

In addition, Denmark will offer NATO a battalion for the defense of the Baltics from mid-2024.

The battalion is expected to be between 700 and 1,200 soldiers and will be deployed in Latvia for parts of the year and will be in Denmark for parts of the year. It is expected to be broadcast between four and six months annually.

A few days ago, [800 Danish soldiers returned home](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/nu-har-de-sidste-danske-soldater-forladt-den-oestlige-flanke-de-traenger-til-puste-ud) from a mission in Latvia because the Army does not have enough resources.

*Troels Lund, how can you ensure that there will be enough personnel in a year's time?*

\- We will have to do something substantial in the short term to strengthen our personnel, but I am not too worried that we should not be able to field this number of soldiers. My concern is that we cannot field a large number of soldiers for a much longer period, simply because we do not have enough soldiers to deploy, he says.

The purpose of the deployment to Latvia is to have a battalion that is ready to move to the Baltics in a crisis situation in light of the current security policy situation, says Foreign Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen (M).

\- In addition to Ukraine, which is the top priority, because Ukraine's security is also our security, we had a more strategic discussion with the committee today about the use of our military resources around the world in the coming years in the light of a completely new security policy landscape, where we now have war in Europe, which naturally means that we must increase our presence there and spend more resources on territorial integrity and advanced presence in the Baltics , he says.

## Less involvement in Iraq

When soldiers are sent to Latvia for parts of the year, it has an impact on the Armed Forces' engagements elsewhere.

\- This means that we absolutely must look at the fact that there are places where we should not have the same presence as we have had, says Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen.

\- Therefore, an increased presence in our own immediate area in the Baltics means that in the future we will reduce our presence and involvement in Iraq, where we have played a leading role for many years, but where it is part of the entire Nato concept that we are a alliance, and we take turns inviting in. Now it is some others who have to take over there, he says.  
 

The contents of the donation package will probably be well received in Ukraine, says DR's defense correspondent, Mads Korsager.

Ukraine has already received what Mads Korsager calls the "knytn√¶ven" - i.e. tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and all the donations that have come in recent months.

\- There has been a little more doubt as to whether Ukraine has had enough of such material which can break through an enemy's entrenchments. Armored vehicles , which can clear mines and such. Some of the things Denmark is donating now. So when you look at the battlefield , it makes sense. Whether that is enough, time will tell.

Ukraine is right now waiting to launch a counter-offensive, says Mads Korsager. And here the Danish contributions will become relevant.

\- It is a given that at some point between now and early autumn there will be a Ukrainian counter-offensive. When it will come is a deep secret, because it must come as a surprise for Russia, he says.

\- But it is expected that it will come soon, when the ground is strong enough to support the armored vehicles - it has a lot to do with the soil in Ukraine. There, the Ukrainians need some tools which, in addition to being able to shoot, can also pry open like a can opener. This is where the Danish vehicles come into the picture, he says.

5935 This shows that by no way the Russians have a solid fire control over the road (yet) and Ukraine manages to keep the road open.  

If they would have had solid  (fire) control Ukraine would be, by no means, able to keep pushing/towing vehicles off the road after being destroyed.

5952 That‚Äôs fucked up. But this is the fruit that war bears. 
As I‚Äôve kept saying in the past, Washington and NATO need to focus less on arming Ukraine and more to bringing both sides on the table to find a compromise which they have been avoiding since the start of the invasion to weaken Russia.

5986 I do find the part about the HIMARS a bit questionable. Didnt they hit target somewhat far behind the frontline in the past? So it dont see how it might be a novelty.

The rest of the article basically describes the issues the ukrainians have and comes to the conclusion that they are very serious and therefor a major attack will likely fail. I think the article is correct about the issues. But how big are these issues and couldnt ukraine overcome them?

I do say that RT conclusion "Ukraine might only does a minor attack to puncture the front" would be stupid by Ukraine. Better dont do any offense the and use the build up forces as respond forces for Russian attacks, if the forces are not strong enough for a major attack. But maybe Ukraine is forced to attack due to political pressure, not sure. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
5987 This is a "low information" outfit that is required to restrict its articles to short bits that fail to look past the next, indeed even the last, 'chess move'.

Here is the truth:

The Western forces, include all of the NATO, do not have the "**industrial capacity**" to manufacture larger weapons systems and their ammunition. 

Every day that passes, the "supply train" for Western Ukrainian forces has less feed into it, and much less exiting the supply train at the front lines to engage in combat.

If there is not a "last horah" Spring Offensive soon, the amount of ordinance available to the Western Ukrainians will have reduced to such a small amount the troops will have virtually nothing to shoot at the he Russian speaking Eastern Ukrainians and Russians.

It's become a "now or never" scenario, and the "now" part is obviously impossible. And with every passing day it is more evidently impossible.

The *"Counteroffensive could end in failure"* should more properly read: *"the Counteroffensive has been bombed by them Rooskies before it got close to the line of contact battlefield, and will either never happen, or only happen sympolicly, with absolutely no chance for long term success."*

---

But, hay, it's a good distraction from the best time to act regarding the collapse of the debt money system, owing ever compounding and unpayable "interest" that mathematically increases at an ever larger, **faster** rate.

5989 Just for context. 
Ru deported ORPHANS from occupied territories to Russia. The west does not recognize the RU referendums in occupied territories, so they are still deemed Ukrainian lands. Under the rome statute RU cannot deport children into a neighbouring country, it is forbidden. 
So all this drama is not about the children at all. Ru did what was best for them. The main argument is if the occupied territories are Ukraine or Russia.

5992 I might be corrupted from all seeing people die in wars from the last decade. But sorry mate this post aint gonna change my stance on war as always with the death of the innocent.

Putin caused it. But war is war and not exclusive to Ukraine. If you want to mourn about the losses of the innocent. Post daily about Syria. Iraq. Afghanistan. Myanmar.Mali. Phillppines. Yemen. Chechnya.Georgia. Armenia and so forth.

But if you want to only post here about this conflict AND mourn about the casualties on civillians don't jsut go all in on Ukraine side. war hurts us all. And pretending like 5 people didnt die in dontesk yesterday (liveua) but then posting tiktoks of people crying to missiles of russia(which we don't know if its shut down warhead straying like the last 3 apartment explosion claims) doesnt make you look like you care for the innocent. It makes you look like you only care propaganda gains against russia and shamelessly using civillians for it.

6001 UA POV - China, India & Brazil vote for UN resolution recognizing "the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and against Georgia prior to that" - United Nations 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
6002 Just to put into context. The resolution that nearly everyone agree on, including China, India and Brazil, is about the cooperation between UN and the Council of Europe. EU is union not a country, but it has the status of "enhanced observer" at the UN. So this resolution was meant to recognize how EU had good relation with UN. 

That being said, in the first two pages of the resolution, you have a set of 9 initial statement made from General assembly concerning the Council of Europe, with one of them being:

>Recognizing  also  that  the  unprecedented  challenges  now  facing  Europe following  the  aggression  by  the  Russian  Federation  against  Ukraine,  and  against  Georgia prior to that, and the cessation of the membership of the Russian Federation in  the  Council  of  Europe,  call  for  strengthened  cooperation  between  the  United Nations and the Council of Europe, notably in order to promptly restore and maintain peace  and  security  based  on  respect  of  the  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity  and political  independence  of  any  State,  ensure  the  observance  of  human  rights  and international humanitarian law during the hostilities, provide redress to victims and bring to justice all those responsible for the violations of international law, 

So while the resolution was not about Georgia or Ukraine, the text does recognize Russia agression toward both of them, and call for restoring territorial  integrity  and bring redress to victims.

Perhaps some ambassadors didn't properly read the text (this resolution was passed 5 days ago and we only learn about this nugget today), or perhaps they didn't consider this paragraph meaning, but it does make it look like Russia has lost a lot of support.

6005 Rule 2: Resolution about "**Cooperation between UN and Council of Europe**", not related to the Ukraine- Russia war. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
6006 That resolution doesn't recognise anything, it's a general call for cooperation between the Council of Europe and the UN. That sentence that mentions Russian aggression evokes the state of European security and is irrelevant to what this non-binding and declarative resolution is about.  
Russian allies representatives, such as China or Brazil, probably concluded that there is no need argue over that irrelevant phrase, because anyway the resolution has no meaning or legal effect, so they voted for that cooperation.  
Official China and Brazil have publicly accused NATO and the West for the crisis and war in Ukraine and maintain close contacts and cooperation with Russia.  
One word in an irrelevant resolution calling for cooperation between the two political institutions will certainly not change that.

6038 leaked documents show Russia has them out numbered massively in bahkmut.....russia is making gains, but Ukrain's fight has been absolutely fierce. Lot of dead on both sides, lot of loss, prigozhin himself said Ukraine is no slouch and they are extremely well trained. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
6039 I don't understand the logic.

Ukraine has mainly been fighting Wagner in Bakhmut. So the attrition math does not really work. Wagner has certainly been depleted. But what of the Russian army? 

You might correctly argue that Bakhmut is draining Russian ammunition. Wagner has complained often of not getting access to ammo stockpiles it knows exist. But Bakhmut is also draining Ukrainian ammunition at about the 25% rate that seems to be an established Russian ammunition advantage (it can bring 4 times the ammunition Ukraine can to combat).

A possibly correct line of think might be that until Wagner has to withdraw to refit, Bakhmut is instead of some other built up area. So may as well drain Wagner there, because it would do the same somewhere else. So not about casualty ratios, but about saving a different urban area from high intensity combat.

By that logic, Ukraine will put in the bodies it needs to put in until Wagner needs to withdraw and refit. I think that moment has passed. Wagner has the staying power to keep fighting, but involved Wagner units will be taken off the line when the fighting is done.

>"They have suspended the export of electricity to Slovakia for several days. The price there is higher than in Ukraine. They suspended it because they couldn't agree on profit redistribution. We export to Moldova, but those are large volumes. We export 75 MW to Poland, but we could export many times more. From May 15th, our system is projected to have a deficit instead of a surplus. We are taking atomic blocks offline for fuel reloading and maintenance work. In the summer, we will have a deficit and potential electricity imports.

6113 Interesting. This says the UAF do not have enough air assets to cover the areas worth striking and they need to pick and choose where to protect. Makes sense they prioritised Kiev, some upper echelons of high command and government would be located there. But that makes cities and staging points closer to the front vulnerable.

6120 Russia‚Äôs State-orchestrated Incitement to Genocide

c) ‚ÄúDenazification‚Äù and Dehumanization. Russian officials and State media repeatedly  invoke ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù as one of the main goals of the invasion and have broadly  described Ukrainians as subhuman (‚Äúzombified,‚Äù ‚Äúbestial,‚Äù or ‚Äúsubordinate‚Äù), diseased or  contaminated (‚Äúscum,‚Äù ‚Äúfilth,‚Äù ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù) or existential threats and the epitome of evil  (‚ÄúNazism,‚Äù ‚ÄúHitler youth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThird Reich‚Äù). This rhetoric is used to portray a substantial  segment or an entire generation of Ukrainians as Nazis and mortal enemies, rendering  them legitimate or necessary targets for destruction.

6121 I know what I'll say will have no effect on pro-war russians but it is hard to tell if some of the "nazi in Ukraine" is faked or not. I mean, I seriously don't know how you guys can tell the guy in the first 2 pictures is the same as the guy on the last 2. Especially when one has a face that seems impossibly square and the other looks "normal". Maybe perspective and all but honestly, they don't look the same.

Honestly speaking, this one looks like a fake, like the one time we saw "sims" game used as a proof to show of nazi activity, like the numbers photoshopped on a tank, etc. There are people paid to litterally create fakes and seeing you guys believe it's the same guy show you're falling for it way too easily.

6125 This is always going to be a problem for Ukrainians. Concentrating armor and troops in one place and being a target for Russian aviation. We dont hear much about Russians hitting ammunition depots, but its likely that large number of cruise missiles are hitting military infrastructure. Ukraine is dispersing their armor and Western weapons cognizant of this vulnerability. But this also makes counteroffensive difficult.

6130 White crosses painted on Ukrainian military vehicles have been circulating on social media for a dozen or so days as a reference to Nazi tank markings during World War II. This narrative is also promoted by official Russian institutions. It is aimed at arousing resentment towards the Ukrainian army and is consistent with the propaganda spread by the Kremlin for years that Kyiv is in fact ruled by the Nazis. However, there is no evidence for such claims, and the analysis indicates that the markings may have a deeper, historical meaning.[https://fakenews.pl/en/politics/there-is-no-evidence-that-white-crosses-on-ukrainian-military-vehicles-are-associated-with-nazi-symbolism/](https://fakenews.pl/en/politics/there-is-no-evidence-that-white-crosses-on-ukrainian-military-vehicles-are-associated-with-nazi-symbolism/)

Governments and large corporations know that the "breading population" of Western Ukraine has been decimated. The potentially best male bread winners and family supporters have mostly fled, but a half million of them have squandered away their potential and gotten themselves killed or to badly wounded to be productive family provider. 

After the SMO, Mother Russia will reinvigorate the poor and significantly depopulated Western Ukraine. Especially the "Russian Jews" *(NOT Biblical Hebrew)* will wish to return to the "Pale of Settlements" as their colonial project in Transjordan (aka: Palestine) turns sour.

6177 Some excerpts from the article. Full  archive [here](https://archive.ph/2MTQN)


According to Chomsky, Russia is acting with restraint and moderation. He compares Russia‚Äôs way of fighting with the US‚Äôs during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that large-scale destruction of infrastructure seen in that conflict ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt happened in Ukraine‚Äù. He adds: ‚ÄúUndoubtedly Russia could do it, presumably with conventional weapons. [Russia] could make Kyiv as unliveable as Baghdad was, could move in to attacking supply lines in western Ukraine.‚Äù

When I asked him to clarify whether he was implying that Russia is fighting more humanely in Ukraine than the US did in Iraq, Chomsky replies, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not implying it, it‚Äôs obvious.‚Äù Delegations of UN inspectors had to be withdrawn once the invasion of Iraq began, he says, ‚Äúbecause the attack was so severe and extreme‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the US and British style of war.‚Äù Chomsky adds: ‚ÄúTake a look at casualties. All I know is the official numbers‚Ä¶ the official UN numbers are about 8,000 civilian casualties [in Ukraine]. How many civilian casualties were there when the US and Britain attacked Iraq?‚Äù

The number of foreign dignitaries who have travelled to Kyiv since the war broke out is proof of Russia‚Äôs restraint, Chomsky says, in stark contrast with Iraq. ‚ÄúWhen the US and Britain were smashing Baghdad to pieces, did any foreign leaders go to visit Baghdad? No, because when the US and Britain go to war, they go for the jugular. They destroy everything: communications, transportation, energy, shock and awe ‚Äì anything that makes society function.‚Äù


....

Asked what form a potential settlement to the war in Ukraine might take, Chomsky says: ‚ÄúFirst of all, Ukraine will not be a member of Nato. That‚Äôs the red line that every Russian leader has insisted on since [the former Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and [the former Soviet president Mikhail] Gorbachev.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúUkraine gains the status of, say, Austria during the Cold War or Mexico today. Mexico can‚Äôt join a military alliance [hostile to the US]. There‚Äôs no treaty about it but it‚Äôs perfectly obvious.‚Äù

6231 If you zoom in, you can see the Wagner standing at the street corner holding a sign that says: "SLOW" with a picture of a mama duck and 3 baby ducks crossing the road.

The Wagner is going as slow as they possibly can, while still maintaining fire-contact with the NATO standards forign legion and Western Ukrainians.

The West is losing 400 fighters a day, and them Rooskies are losing like 20 troops a day.

And the Wagner fiddles while Bakhmut burns. 

Number 1 job in Bakhmut, **artillery spotter**. Number 2 job in Bakhmut, support for protecting the artillery spotter.

There is no reason for Russia to advance, accept when all return fire stops because the Western Ukrainians ran away, then them Rooskies need to re-aquire targets, and that is the only reason them Rooskies advance.

6237 UA Pov - Poland's Top General : The situation does not look good, Ukraine is very far from winning - Dorzeczy.pl 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , post
6238 Google Translated

 ‚Äì When I look at the war in Ukraine, I mainly see it through these political lenses, and unfortunately it does not look good ‚Äì he assessed. He explained that in the short planning perspective, 1-2 years, "there is nothing to suggest that Russia does not have money for the war." ‚Äì The financial instruments that it had before the war, the dynamics of spending and the effectiveness of sanctions or the entire complex economic situation indicate that¬† [Russia will have money for the war](https://dorzeczy.pl/ekonomia/433351/wywiad-usa-rosji-wystarczy-pieniedzy-na-kolejny-rok-wojny.html) ‚Äì he added.

‚Äì Ukraine has huge financial problems. We know how much he needs a month. We know what the American help is like, the whole civilizational West. We also know what Polish aid is like in this area, because we are the second donor and we should probably be a significant inspiration for others. The speed of abrasion in the financial area is, in my opinion, unfavorable today (Ukrainy - ed.). Unfortunately, he said.

 He also pointed out that in the near future there is no indication that the Ukrainians who fled the war will return home and start the process of rebuilding the country. He stressed that the July NATO summit in Vilnius will be "more of a peak of our credibility, not only NATO's, but the entire West's." ‚Äì If we are late, if we do not use this opportunity and do not show determination, we will not give Ukraine a chance to build its secure future ‚Äì he stressed.

‚Äì As a soldier, I am also obliged to present the most unfavorable and difficult to implement variant, giving a field to all those who can and should help Ukraine. I consider this security situation as very bad, very dangerous for Poland ‚Äì said Andrzejczak.

Asked whether Western leaders realize that Ukraine is very far from winning the war with Russia, the general replied that "the unadorned perspective of assessing threats is still a surprise to most, still shocking."

We just don't have ammunition. The industry is not ready not only to send equipment to Ukraine, but also to replenish our stocks, which are melting. This awareness is not the same as here on the Vistula River, and it must be absolutely, without anesthesia, conveyed to everyone and in all forums, wherever possible, which I am doing, stressed the chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces.

6239 I think the last part is really the most important..the issue with having spent a year and a bit acting like russians are unintelligent mindless 0gres that just eat Ukrainian bullets for breakfast combined with only ever showing Ukrainian success has lead to a population that thinks Ukraine is definitively winning and mowing down russians 10:1. So when sobering truths need to be told they will likely be dismissed as fearmongering or being a " ruZsian asset"

6264 Quick deepl translation of the vid description. Source in the video.

---

On the alleged forcible deportation of Ukrainian children, which PACE today recognized as genocide 

I still follow the fate of the boy Vova, who was recently "forcibly evacuated" from Bakhmut by Wagner PMC fighters.

Since our last meeting, things have gotten even better for him. He and his mother were able to find her parents and finally the family was fully reunited in one of the cities of the DPR.

So that the boy wasn't lonely and could adjust faster after the horror he had lived through, the musicians, in addition to the tablet gave him a soccer and a longboard. 

Surprisingly, the boy's mother, "forcibly evacuated with him," during the conversation, could not stand it and gave Zelensky a message on camera:

"Only our Mr. President says that you take us away by force, we are bought and we give you interviews for money. No, Mr. President, relax. We really say thank you very much to the PMCs. They're not like your soldiers who shot us in the back, smashed up our homes and killed our families. I want you to be in our shoes. With your relatives, with your parents, so that at three o'clock in the morning your house would burn down with your relatives. I want you to feel it on your own skin. I swear: it was not bought and no one paid me anything," the woman said.

By the way, today, with the direct participation of the mayor, an employee of the PMC "Wagner" began to solve the issue with the employment of "forcibly evacuated" parents of the boy. Preliminarily, they will go to work at a local city-forming enterprise with the subsequent issue of housing.

Oh, this is quite a lot of violence.

6267 Whatever the belief the rubber boat hit a mine and made all other arguments about his intentions moot.   He would not have been a Ukrainian fisherman as they are banned from this activity in the war zone and in any case anyone risking fishing would be at risk from fire from either side.  I tend to suspect what is more widely reported - it was a Russian soldier trying to surrender and it ended badly due to an underwater mine.

-----------------------

>The head of the Defense Committee of the State Duma, Andrei Kartopolov, believes that the local population can be involved in protecting the Russian borders. According to him, this is due to the fact that Russia does not have the ability to protect the borders along the entire perimeter, as it was in the USSR.

>‚ÄúUnfortunately, we now do not have such opportunities as in the Soviet Union, when the entire country along the perimeter was guarded by military units of the border troops of the USSR. Therefore, now there are somewhat different ways of protecting borders. But to involve the local population on a voluntary basis, in my opinion, this is quite realistic and understandable. This is practiced in many countries. Including in the former enlightened Europe,‚Äù Andrey Kartapolov told Ura.ru.

>Andrey Kartapolov believes that first you need to allow the combatants to guard the borders, and then decide what conditions are necessary for this. ‚ÄúIt is important to make a decision in principle: yes or no. That is, we trust our people in terms of responsibility for the security of our border areas. If we trust, then we trust. And then the technology is already beginning to take shape: what units, how many there will be, what kind of organization they will be, ‚Äùhe said.

>In the Belgorod and Kursk regions bordering Ukraine, the formation of volunteer people's squads began last year to protect the country's borders. Their preparation, among other things, is carried out by Wagner PMC. In December 2022, the governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said that since the start of the special military operation, more than 2,000 people had joined the people's squads.

>Earlier, Secretary of the General Council of United Russia Andrey Turchak proposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to give the fighters of the territorial defense of voluntary people's squads the right to carry weapons.

>On March 2, a group of saboteurs from the territory of Ukraine penetrated into the villages of Sushany and Lyubechane, Bryansk region. Responsibility for this was assumed by the "Russian Volunteer Corps", fighting on the side of the armed forces of Ukraine.

6278 The Russians certainly aren't being very considerate guests in Ukraine.

The Russian lines are always trash heaps: their dead lay where they fell; their wounded crawl to their final resting spot; come the thaw weather, the decomposition takes hold.

Depending on the wind direction, there are going to be a mighty bad smell for quite some time.

Maybe one plus will be the addition of organic chemicals to the Ukrainian soil.  That's if the Russians have left toxins in their wake, which, of course they did.

6286 Something that just occurred to me; NATO has no reason to fear escalation from Russia, at least directly, due to MAD and their alliance so the only place that Russia would be able to "escalate" is Ukraine itself which it's already in a war with.  But Russia probably doesn't have the capability for a step change in escalation in Ukraine (at least right now) because otherwise they'd be making gains which they largely aren't.

I think that a Ukraine without serious Western backing would've already fallen or at least be on the ropes by now, and based on what I've read about the Russian army, Russia still hasn't committed a serious force to the conflict, at least to the level that one would expect to conquer the second largest country in Europe.

This is definitely the most consequential post-Soviet conflict yet.

6305  I think that we get into this discussion of Nazis too much. Sure there are elements of the Ukrainian army that have Nazis, just as there are elements of the Russian army that are Nazis as well. Right wing fundamentalist tend to be militant and are draw into the fray. They wear their stupid little Nazi patches and pretend they are changing the world based on their misdirected ideology.

This has to be separated from Nazi behavior at the governmental level. This is systematically trying to destroy a nation, its identity and its people by unilateral government supported invasive military action coupled with a concerted propaganda effort. This undermines peace in the territory.

I do not support Nazi soldiers in either the Ukrainian or Russian military. These are idiots and they are not representative of their country as a whole. More importantly, I think the world should always push back on governments that act like Nazis like the Russian government currently is.

All this financial aid thats going their way is probably already distributed in even shares and there is nothing anyone can say to change my mind, once corrupt, always corrupt, especially when the corruption was so large as it was in UA case. Just cause the West is trying to promote them into a shining beacon of democracy for the past year doesnt change the fact that the same media kept posting articles on how corrupt and hopeless Ukraine is.

The literal only reason they‚Äôre getting overwhelming support is because they‚Äôre against Russia, and as the narrative goes Russia bad.

6328 When everyone thinks the same, no one thinks at all.

This American Czech president lookalike makes a good point. One that we all were starting to feel creep into our subconscious. What we are told about Ukraine winning does not match up with what we are seeing in Ukraine. 

This war is a hologram for many in the West. It is simply whatever is told to us on the media, meaning they can project whatever narrative and make it seem true. 

What is scary about this situation is how the media in the West has shifted from criticism to blind acceptance.  

If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan, you had media outlets criticizing various aspects of those wars or even rejecting them. 

Going back even further to Vietnam, the media initially was supportive of the war (NYT, Atlantic, WaPo, etc) but eventually became very critical. Although there were major voices who were critical of the war throughout. 

It seems strange that today everyone agrees and has the same opinion of this war. Every media outlet has been saying Ukraine is winning.

6331 No shit? The invasion of Ukraine havent damaged the submarine arm? They are locked out of the Black Sea? How should they be able to fight them? And with what?

The Russian Army and ground forces have taken a bearing though. The airforce have lost more planes than they expected, including some of their toptier planes and helicopters.

No proof of large scale corruption in Ukraine. The western allies have put money into Ukraine, but mainly old stock weapons, therefor not out of pocket money.

So all of western media fails to see what this insignificant American "news" outlet sees?

Riiiiight......

6337  And Ukraine has already responded. That's precisely why I don't fully support either side, despite leaning towards Ukraine. Both parties, including the users here, tend to complain about every action taken by the other side, yet they celebrate their own similar actions‚Äîeven if it's just a parody in this case. It was the opposite situation with the Crimean Bridge and the infrastructure attacks two days later.

Both countries, as state actors, are terrible.

6342 A lot these NATO flag pro-UKR twitter accounts have this doge meme either as a banner or as their pfp. Did I miss something? Is this some inside joke? Is this done to be relatable to gen z?

I mean you have people with a Ukrainian flag in their bio/name, which is normal. But then you get this collection of anonymous twitter accounts who also add the NATO flag and most of the time share military clips with bloodthirsty captions along with meme language which feel forced, and that kind of pro-UKR is cringe. Almost as if they are not exactly pro-Ukraine and do not really care about them, but are more like pro-NATO or anti-Russia...

6375 Hypothetically... if a nuke suddenly went off in Bakhmut, say at the Medical Collage(pretty much front line-grey zone)... who would have orchestrated it?

Or not even Bakhmut but anywhere in Ukraine, a large portion of people on reddit assume there would be some sort of immediate response from one side(namely the west since the constant talk of Russian threats of nukes is always pushed by our MSM)... Would there be an immediate response?  

Think about it, there is still ZERO concrete proof of either side pulling of the Pipeline operation, how would one go about proving a nuclear detonation was the fault of one side or the other in the middle of a warzone?

Russia and Ukraine definitely wouldn't gain much for a tactical nuke being used... but a third party could make a fucking fortune if they played the market right.

6377 For all the money the "West" has thrown at Ukraine, we could have instead given each and every Rooskie combat soldier a million dollars to lay down their weapon and sit this war out on the sidelines.

As for the supply of ammunition of all types, it has been starkly evident that the "West" is incapable of supplying it to the soldiers fighting on behalf of Western Ukraine.

There is what is called an "escalation ladder" of ever more powerful and long range weapons systems, as well as destruction of infrastructure that separate modern society from the candle light and horse powered societies of a few hundred years ago. 

It is up to the West how far up that "escalation ladder" they want to go, but them Rooskies can and will always go one step higher than the West could or would choose to go.

6385 They've been teaching this since 1991, they knew this conflict was coming, they were getting ready for it for a long time. Right Sector, UNA-UNSO and the like didn't appear after 2014, in 2014 they triumphed and finally overthrew the "neutral" Ukraine of Kuchma and Yanukovich. Russia also knew that past this point negotiations about anything were impossible, all progress that had been made would be rolled back including the Kharkov Agreements on the Black Sea base and the Regional Language law passed by the Party of Regions. Russia knew then that divorce proceedings would have to commence, this is what we are seeing now.

6389 What is the goal of the Ukrainian counteroffensive exactly? Take back as much as they can and then what? As much as I want Ukraine to prevail, it‚Äôs looking more like they‚Äôre going to need to come to the table while they still have leverage.

After the counteroffensive, and another likely Russian offensive that will regain at least some of that territory, we‚Äôll be back at square one, just minus thousands of lives. 

Best case scenario, Ukraine reclaims territory from about summer of off last year. They simply don‚Äôt have the capabilities to retake Crimea and Donetsk. Even if they did, most of the people there don‚Äôt want to be Ukraine, which is part of the origin story of this whole conflict.

It pains me to say it, but I think Ukraine is going to have to make some concessions and admit they‚Äôre not going to be part of any western alliances anytime soon.

Then Ukraine could cease fire, work on rebuilding and rooting out the deep corruption that plagues it. Putin dies. Then maybe in another generation things will have cooled down. 

I just don‚Äôt see another option. Ukraine can‚Äôt win a prolonged war of attrition. They just can‚Äôt, even with western weapons which certainly are running low, along with U.S. support. They need to just accept this very difficult pill to swallow and initiate negotiations while they‚Äôre still in the fight and have leverage.

6390 Will Bakhmut hold till a Ukrainian counteroffensive starts? 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
6391 I find Rybar maps are good for using as tissue to blow my nose and wipe my ass, but not particularly useful for anything else.

The amount of copium coming from pro-russian supporters is quite funny.  Everywhere where Ukraine has engaged in offense and retaken large portions of land is just fiction in the eyes of the Kremlin crowd.  Now Ukraine is playing the middle of the ice,  skating down the clock and wearing out the opponent with fast line changes and an active passing game (hockey analogy) to the point where they commence their next big push.  And the other side is running on fumes for something with which to counter.

As for all those fixed defenses?  I know how I would deal with them and my biggest curiosity is whether Ukraine will use the same methodology or something new.  To me all those trench lines and mine fields are a minor hindrance.  

Enjoy the show everyone,  I know I will as I watch Ukraine take back most if not all of its country.

6401 14 thousand too many, but still nowhere near enough for it to be genocide. Famines and civil wars now have killed more people per week than this entire war has, and yet nobody seems to care. Millions of Arabs dead at NATO hands, nobody bats an eye, 14 thousand dead Ukrainians, and all of a sudden Russians are called orc barbarians and America is the bastion of moralality.

May the Ukrainian regime go on the offensive till their heart's content, and hopefully then realise that a magical stiener counterattack with western wunderwaffe won't save them on a strategic, long term level.

6402 So 14.000 in 14 months, lets make it 12.000 yearly to assume . thats 144000 in 12 years according to Totally trustable and not inflated numbers Kyiv independent

UN report puts 8000 killed and 14000 wounded on civillian casualties

Sad once again civillians caught up in the war. Fuck Putin's ambitions

That aside its even sadder for another factoid. why I said 144k in 12 years? because syria imploded 12 years ago (time flies) and its civillian death toll is AT LEAST 306 THOUSAND. ON A HIATUS conflict for a long time. Its TWICE as worst for civillians in Ukraine. But nobody even cried for them or asked them to stop. RU and US (especially US) bombed the shit out of them. used them as proxy for interest. At least Trump straight up [admitted that people died for the oil lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U10p3Tn9V5Y). Its very sad for me that war that is bloodier for humanity is ignored just because its against "democratic blocs" interests (What I mean is the action NATO and EU took vs Syria). An unavoidable dark truth that highlights humans as a whole

> Residents of the temporarily occupied territories advocating for "forcible change of the foundations of the constitutional order" in Russia (and therefore in the territories it has seized), financing "terrorist and extremist activities", or participating in "unauthorised" actions will be deported and banned from entering the Russian Federation.

People who don't have Russian citizenship *and* collaborate with the Ukrainian government or commit other crimes will be subject to deportation. This also isn't going to be implemented until July 1, 2024. There's a good chance the war will be over by then. The title makes it seem like Russia's going to deport everyone with Ukrainian citizenship from the annexed territories.

6407 tl;dr:

Putin‚Äôs decree stipulates that citizens of Ukraine or holders of passports issued by Russian-controlled puppet "republics", Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic and Luhansk People‚Äôs Republic, must either become Russian citizens or declare that they do not wish to do so. Those who choose the latter will be considered foreigners from 1 July 2024 and may be deported.

I wonder if they're trying to cause a refugee crisis to put more strain on Ukraine. On the other hand they are deporting military aged men too who will have a bone to pick with Russia so this might not work out for them that well. Unless this serves as an incentive for them to assimilate faster.

6419 This has been obvious for 9 years right? 

viktor yanukovych was elected mainly because of his pro European words, he fooled his voters and strengthened ties with Russia (Russia may have coordinated this or this was the plan of the pro Russians). People revolted, this is also mainly because kiev is in pro west territory (usa in coordinated this or the vast majority were really pro west).

Then putin saw his plan fall apart, his viktor failed and had to flee to Russia. Putin decided to send mercenaries to eastern Ukraine, so it is obvious that these are veterans of Russia right?

In the end it was the pro Russians who did not accept democracy and Russia sent the green men like Wagner. Then suddenly there were armed residents/mercenaries and then is it crazy that there would be a conflict with the government army army? What do you think would happen if Texas armed itself and resisted?

By the way, by the same decree, Putin officially acknowledged that the Russian army had invaded Ukraine in 2014. Earlier, the Russian authorities stated that there was no Russian military on the territory of Ukraine in 2014.

6437 I wonder when the Ukrainian military will stop "exchanging" military facilities for residential buildings? The missile hit a house only because the Ukrainian air defense forces shot it down over the city, without thinking of the civilians. 

And after that, the Ukrainian terrorists decided to take revenge for the actions of their own air defense forces and struck the center of Donetsk, hitting a hospital and a bus full of people. Ukraine is a terrorist country that kills people both in the territories it controls and in the territories it has already lost. 
 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
6438 These kinds of attacks are ever more pointless.  Looks like Russia is just back to lobbing missiles into civilian targets again. Only thing it's doing is reinforcing an extreme hostility towards anything Russian in Ukraine.

Russia is going to be suffering the consequences of this terror campaign for decades after like Islamic extremist which took off largely after all of the debacles in the middle East.

Such a moronic and strategically useless campaign.

6439 This past week must have been a joy for Russians. 1 year into a war, and they have finally started doing something besides fertilizing Ukrainian soil.

Not very sustainable losses for Ukraine, these. Unless EU / NATO start ramping up the production of equipment and ammo, Russia will win this war in long term.  This war could have been a lot more different if Ukraine was supported for actual war from the start, instead of guerilla one.

6440 My trust in the footage I see from both sides is becoming surrounded with fog.  Its hard to believe the credibility of either sides footage.  Yes it is likely that they are dead Ukrainians , however when you see a very similar video a day earlier claiming them to be KIA of Russia, it definitely clouds my judgement. Especially considering I wouldnt put it past either side to lie in this situation.

6444 If any Western Ukrainian does not want to become a statistic, and wants to live a full life, simply do not pick up weapons and do not go to the comparatively very small part of Ukraine that is the battlefield.

 Ukraine Foreign Relations , comment
6447 Good article. This time the Russians dont have the excuse of being unprepared. If Ukraine has major success, they might win the war (except for crimea, I cant see how this will return to Ukraine in this war).

I would say a major success would be the interruption of the landbridge to crimea (by taking melitopel for example) or the encirclement/capture of Donesk or Lugansk. If they achieve this, there might be even turmoil within russia.

If Ukraine fails, it depends if NATO is commited to rebuild the ukrainian army again. Otherwise could be game over.

I think/hope this war might end this year (or at least switched back to a low scale conflict).

Can you guys decide if Russia is sending cannonfodder prisoners or if Ukraine has killed every single professional solider in the region?

 I'm not sure that the western tanks will be enough to make up for all the advantages Ukraine had last year, but lost over the last 6 months. A repeat of the rapid offensive last year hasn't happened, and they couldn't even hold Bakhmut, which can now be used to flank from the north assuming an attack on Crimea.

Churches were burned with all their parishioners. Isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives. Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away."[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-no_simple_victory-72) In total, the estimated numbers of Polish and Jewish civilians killed in Volhynia and Galicia is between 50,000 and 100,000.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-79)[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-80)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-:0a-5)"

6590 I‚Äôm not excusing nazism but it really seems like the ones that do the salute probably have the sense of humour of a 12 year old. The context is essentially ‚Äúlol we‚Äôre riding German ranks in our own territory fighting soviet/Russian era tanks, omg it‚Äôs just like WW2 lol)

Like it looks bad and it is bad, but I can‚Äôt be alone in thinking this whenever I see a r-slurred Ukrainian soldier not linked to the far right pulls a stunt like that when they handle German or western weapons.

One idiot during the early months of the war really wore ww2 era German equipment like they were larping. Like it‚Äôs bad and sue and they may have passive approval of Nazis and might sympathise with them and other far right groups, but those types exist everywhere in Europe? Even in liberal circles that don‚Äôt like nazis still find it in themselves spouting Nazi era truisms because Nazi era propaganda has stood the test of time.

I understand that azov and other far right neo nazi groups are embedded in the army, I know they behave like a state within a state because national politics means nothing to them when they have been given free reign to run educational camps and organisations to spread their diseased pseudo scientific race sciences and pseudo historical truisms about the Nazis to better indoctrinate nationalists into their cause.  That‚Äôs bad. That‚Äôs what we should be worried about.

6607 I expect cases like this to increase in the next few weeks in parallel with some kind of campaign by Ukraine to reclaim their land. Nothing better than keeping some Russian forces busy in the hinterland to try and stop things like that and unable to actually try to defend the front.

The generally accepted number for maintaining security (i.e. Avoiding an insurgency) is 18-20 soldiers per 1,000 citizens in occupied territory. The Donbas has 4.1 million residents. To minimise things like this, Russia would need around 80,000 plus soldiers behind the front in Donbas trained to and working to keep the peace. It doesn't.

6616 Sorry, I don¬¥t take this stuff seriously. 1. The Russian army has to so weak that the support of Ukraine is worth it, because Ukraine can actually win. 2. At the same time the Russian army has to be so strong, that higher expenses for military in NATO countries are needed. One statement might be correct, but not both.

And if someone claims that Russia might lose now against Ukraine, but might still be dangerous in the future due to a change to war economy, we still have the issue with sanctions. The minimum effect they should have, is that there is no net gain of russian capability to fight a war. Why else have the sanctions? And if there is no net gain of russian capability, the military expenses of NATO countries today should be enough, because of 1.

Raise your hand if you've seen video of German feline tanks engaged in combat in Ukraine. *(Crickets)*

Only 3% of Western Ukrainian fighters who became casualties ever see a Russian speaking Eastern Ukrainian or Russian. The rest of them are hit with indirect fire, the kind the NATO refuses to give to the Western Ukrainians in significant quantities.

6681 If anyone here actually believes that America or the West would retaliate to a nuclear strike on Ukraine, you are dreaming. 

No one in the West is going to sacrifice themselves, since Russia has enough nukes to wipe out Europe and much of America, over Ukraine. We will say that we will.

But we already have escape doors in place. We say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not party to the conflict‚Äù or that we are just ‚Äúhelping Ukraine‚Äù.  That is so we can weasel out of a difficult situation in Ukraine, like nukes, in order to save ourselves.

6682 You know how you can tell when a a country who claims they're "winning" is lying? 

They keep talking about last-resort measures in response to "a threat to the very existence of their state" üòÇ

Go home, Russia. Your "existence" will continue just fine after Ukraine reclaims their territory (including Crimea).

6722 HIMARS has been an absolute game changer.

American military commenters have even said they didn't expect himars to have anything like this influence over the war, but along with the Stugna P and shoulder launched anti tank weapons, the himars system have been probably the most effective weapons system of this war.

The absolute devastation smashed onto the Russian forces by HIMARS will be the story of legend for future Ukrainians children and their kids...

3rd: to one who managed to bump into the American drone‚Ä¶

6934  

Nearly two and a half years ago, we reported on an American adversary air services provider, Air USA, that was set to acquire the vast majority of the Royal Australian Air Force's deeply upgraded F/A-18A/B Hornet fleet. Fast forward to today and Air USA has a new name, RAVN Aerospace, but no ex-RAAF Hornets.

Considering what is happening in Ukraine, and the country's extreme need for Western fourth-generation fighter capabilities, having dozens of upgraded F/A-18s in good condition just languishing in storage seems like a remarkable missed opportunity. With this in mind we set out to get to the bottom of the status of the Hornets and what could be possible not just in terms of providing fighters for Kyiv's cause but also rapidly training pilots and ground crews to support that cause.

The original plan was for Air USA to acquire 46 Hornets. Canada had bought 25 prior to the deal with Air USA to help bolster its aging CF-18 fleet. The Australian Hornets are largely upgraded to an A++ standard, which gives them the capabilities of newer F/A-18Cs, including the type's upgraded AN/APG-73 radar.

In addition, these Hornets have never been battered around on an aircraft carrier or exposed to constant salt water during deployment. So we are talking about nearly four dozen highly relevant and well-cared-for fighters here. This is pretty much the size of Ukraine's MiG-29 fleet, prior to recent transfers from NATO supporters, the type serving as the backbone of its current fighter force.

When it comes to the Australian Department of Defense, which publicized the deal with Air USA when it was struck, you'd think a simple inquiry as to the status of their surplus Hornets and the deal to export them to the United States would be a simple ask. That has not been the case. Repeated attempts to get them to comment on any of this have gone unanswered. It is totally unclear why this is the case. There is hardly anything secret about retired Hornets sitting in storage.

As for the State Department, which would be critical for allowing the re-import or re-export of the Hornets, all a spokesperson could say was, "as a matter of policy, we are unable to comment on or confirm specific potential defense trade licensing activity." So no luck there.

RAVN Aerospace also declined to provide official comment on the situation with the Hornets at this time.

In the meantime, we have even heard rumors that if the Hornets do not get exported, they could be destroyed. This is hardly out of character for the RAAF, which famously buried its F-111 "Pig" swing-wing combat jet fleet after retirement. Doing so to the Hornets would be a shame, bordering on outrageous, considering there is a country very much in need of fourth-generation fighters.

There has also been some talk that Finland's relatively pristine F/A-18C/Ds could be provided to Ukraine. This makes little sense at this time as the country will be converting over to the F-35A starting in 2026. This was further swatted down by officials recently under that same logic ‚Äî they need their Hornets now more than ever. But Finland's Hornets could be ideal candidates to bolster Ukraine's fleet of ex-RAAF Hornets towards the latter half of the decade, as the country transitions to the F-35A. That process should be complete by around 2030. Finland has roughly 62 F/A-18C/Ds.

Spain is also drawing down its EF-18 Hornet fleet and looks to unload it entirely by the end of the decade. The Hornet is also in the twilight of its service life with Switzerland, where 25 of the type will serve into the early 2030s when they will be replaced more than in full by the F-35A.

Canada will be operating its upgraded and expanded CF-18 fleet until the F-35 arrives in full, but now there is a clearer timeline on when that will actually happen. The F-35 transition will begin in the second half of this decade. Once it is complete, nearly 100 F/A-18 airframes will become surplus.

So hundreds of CF-18s will eventually be offered for transfer or spare parts by the end of the decade.

There are also 40 Kuwaiti F/A-18C/Ds, some of the best-condition Hornets around, that are still up for grabs. Malaysia, which operates the F/A-18D and will continue to do so well into the 2030s, has had an interest in them, as have the U.S. Marine Corps. And that brings us to the latter. Nearly 100 F/A-18C/Ds will serve the USMC at least until the end of the decade in a highly upgraded form. Support and training within the NAVAIR ecosystem are still going strong and hundreds of Legacy Hornets have recently been retired from the U.S. Navy and USMC, leaving a large inventory of parts.

The point of all this is that while the F-16 gets discussed almost solely as the right fighter for Ukraine based on support and airframe availability, it is hardly the only option and second-hand F-16s are a far hotter commodity than most think. Not just foreign air arms, but the Pentagon itself is using retired F-16s, with the Navy equipping its preeminent aggressor squadron with retired USAF Vipers, for instance. Many others have gone to the QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) program. There is also major demand for them via private adversary support contractors. This is in addition to increasing demand overall for F-16s around the globe.

Yes, the F-16 has the most impressive training and support infrastructure, but the F/A-18 still has that infrastructure, as well, and will be flooded with spare parts as more Hornets retire. More on that in a moment.

In terms of capabilities and performance, the F/A-18 is arguably better suited for Ukraine than the F-16. As a twin-engine design that excels at slow-speed handling, it is more in line with Ukraine's MiG-29 and Su-27 fleets. Its very robust carrier-capable landing gear is also better suited for Ukraine's Soviet-era airfield infrastructure and potential for distributed and austere operations, which Ukraine has been executing to make targeting harder for Russian forces. Like the F-16, it can carry pretty much anything that would be available to Ukraine now and in the future and can be quickly adapted to handle new capabilities if need be.

While upgraded with advanced targeting pods, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS), and many other enhancements, the ex-RAAF jets are not cutting edge and would present reduced technological risk in their current form. This makes them deliverable with minimal modifications.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
6973 Israel has pushed this idea the most, with its [Namer IFV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namer). If a nation state has plenty of tank chassis with outdated sensors or worn-out main guns, and is fighting non-state actors, the idea has merit. Proof against everything up to RPGs, at least in frontal arcs.

But for future near-peer conflict, they're just as vulnerable to top attack ATGMs/loitering munitions, or mines, as any tank, too heavy for much rural road infrastructure, have high maintenance costs and logistics tail, have poor entry/egress, and are cramped inside. In the near term, when all near peers have loitering drones and NLAWs (etc), the most dangerous place on the front lines may be inside a conspicuous IFV (whether heavy or light). I think the future for most militaries is lower cost but roomy 8x8 IFVs (Patria AMV/LAV-25/Boxer/Piranha etc), proof against small arms, shrapnel, and with slat armor add-ons, basic RPG-7s; 16-30 metric tons.

6982 ‚ÄãWhy NATO Wasn't Even Trying to Adapt MiG-29 for Western Missiles | Defense Express 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , post
6983 The article confirms its major flaws: short range, lack of in flight refuelling and limited electronics.

I believe that Soviet doctrine at the time of the MiG 29 and Su-27 was ground radar guided interception, and the MiG was still a manoeuvrable aircraft but still inferior to the Su-27 which was the better - but much more expensive fighter, and possibly better suited for hunting than the -29, especially in a modern Electronic Warfare environment.

I remember reading a long time ago that even if Russia did export / gift some of their top of the line airframes of the time (MiG 23/25/27) which were powerful aircraft within their respective limitations, to friendly 3rd nations, they were also maintenance intensive and would only fly for about a month - possibly less - if that nation became less friendly and the USSR would stop providing parts, effectively grounding the fleet. I'm guessing that the MiG-29 is the extension for that, and even if on esthetics, the -29 is the prettier plane, the Sukhoi 27 was designed as the air superiority "F-15 killer". Of course this is not a massive problem to overcome when the client state had a working aviation industry - and when the USSR imploded and became (at the time) a much friendlier country.

I also read a document written by a Soviet General who defected who also noted that the T-72 tanks that were exported to 3rd nations also were downgraded versions of the Soviet ones, lacking NBC protection and only contained the previous generation fire control systems, giving the Soviets the upper hand of ever their troops needed to go up against that nation, through Ukraine has also proven that the Soviet designs don't even seem to match up to previous generation anti tank weapons despite all their research.

7005 Just to actually give you an answer on how they would use only 31 of them is as support/defense tanks they have longer range than most/if not all on the battle field so they‚Äôre gonna be a big threat to all the old tanks/btrs/vehicles Russia is sending but the real reason we even sent them is for other country‚Äôs to send their tanks to. people still look at the US to do shit first to see if it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôs dumb but we‚Äôll prolly send more if Ukraine can operate them well and i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll have a problem so out of the like 5-6k I think are already sitting around we have enough to send a few hundred in my opinion at least

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7008 Because they are a huge pain in the ass to maintain and the reason we are sending them at all is to make it politically okay for our partners to send what they really want, leopard 2 tanks. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7009 It‚Äôs a test batch to figure out training, support, and the logistic tail. Once they trial and error some things they will put what they learn into practice and send more tanks. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7010 The abrams engine is (dont nail me on tec. details) powered by a "jet" turbine. So its fuel is kerosene. As already mentioned in the comments, it's completely different in maintenance. Also it could be a reason that its speculated, that German leader Olaf Scholz told Biden, that he will only send Leopard2 tanks to ukraine, if the US sends heavy tanks (abrams) too. So maybe Biden was like: "here you got some, and now send leopards!" 

All together: the war is not over yet and I'm pretty sure that "the west" (us included) will send more tanks in the next months/years. Just like germany allowed Poland to send five MIGs to Ukraine.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7014 There are "export" versions with the DU armor (M1A1 Supers) in storage that could be sent almost immediately.  The issue, at least the selling point on the issue, is maintenance, and logistical support for parts/materials in addition to training.  However, the same could be said for F-16's, Apaches & Super Cobras, and MRZR's but if our White House had a set of cajones we could have already had the Ukrainians trained and have these "stored" systems in their arsenal and perhaps had saved that poor soul of whom the f\*\*king Russians cut his head off along with many others!

No composite armour, just steel that is not thicker than 120mm on the hull. Can be penetrated by any AT weapon made since 1960.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7023 You might as well call these things "metal coffins" as they are so obsolete that the cramped interior (12% smaller than modern tanks) will crush you with a side hit. These are very  slow firing tanks meaning, after the tank fires it's first shot,  it will be spotted and eliminated by a drone before it's second shot. They are the slowest moving tanks of modern tanks so again even in evacuation, they will be an easy target.

Flight path already past the point of explosion. 
No smoldering wreck or continuous smoke on the ground.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7143 I've read worse.  FWIW, we have seen duels between the gun used on the upgraded T-55s and the T-72.  The 105mm gun won everyone of them.  

The Ukrainian T-55s they're talking about have the gun off the old M-60 that uses a 105mm APFSDS DU round.  It's also the same gun the Leopard 1's and the M-1 Abrams were first outfitted with back in the early 1980s, right before NATO was fully into the 120mm upgrade program to counter-act the T-80 and other projected Russian advances in armor.

Anyway, the 105mm NATO gun was used in the first Gulf War as the US Marines were still using M-60A3 tanks.  The Marines compiled an impressive record in blowing up Iraqi tanks (T-55s, T-62s and T-72s) by racking up a 100-to-0 kill/loss record many of which were T-72s.  

Like the Abrams with the 120mm gun, the M-60s were also quite capable of one-shot, one-kill direct fire actions.  I expect the same for these T-55s that have been upgraded to the NATO standards/capabilities of the M-60s.

As some may have noticed, I've said this whole time the Russian army (and the Chinese army) is a fucking joke and its strength was nothing more than western propaganda to excuse big defense budgets.  For all the fearmongering our defensive industry and Pentagon 'experts' has done, Russian equipment was always vastly inferior to US equipment, and it's been that way for 100+ years.

7151 looks like the southern counter-offensive is ramping up. they're running the himars and mlrs full-time to soften up the front lines. i think the last package included 30k mlrs rockets, which means 1k rockets per night for a month before the counter-offensive.

7152 Does any one know about the strikers capabilities? I'm only familiar with the Abrams and the Bradley. I thought it was made for Afghanistan/Iraq which was a fight against a lightly equipped force. And this seems like a slug fest for the heavy weights.

I'm sure light armor is better then no armor but I worry that its being over leveraged as I thought it was designed for a different fight.

7185 That is genius. 

My dad was a US officer in VietNam. He told me, several times, of the time he came "home" from work - his tent, shared with several others - his buddies were drinking beer, and cutting the fuses on grenades short. The idea was to toss a crate of sabotaged grenades on the side of the road. When the guys who wore black pajamas came in missing hands and fingers, well, it was obvious.

Protip: if you must use enemy munitions, give them a thorough inspection first.

Also: don't fuck with Americans. Have you seen our health care system? And what, we are supposed to give a shit about our enemies??? lol

Oh, anyways, great use of munitions. Warms the cockles of my heart. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7186 BUK is still very plausible system. Unfortunately, when Finland gave up BUK, it was said that rocket fuel would need to be replaced every ten years (source?). This would mean that decommissioned vehicles should work as intended, but munition may have lost its capabilities. So the question is not whether it is free for Ukraine, but rather is it reasonable to spare time, money and effort to ship something that only works 50% of the time.

We also need to create a ¬£1 billion fund just to mass build attack drones for UA. There should be an FPV kamikaze drones for every russian soldier. We literally need to blot out the sky with drones so the russians fight in the shade.

7217 Contrast the comments here vs the comments on the [story about China's exercise earlier this week in the same airspace](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/132l0fs/china_flies_38_aircraft_including_a_combat_drone). 

The only reasons these stories continue to be news is because people don't understand what Air Defence Identification Zones actually are and what they are not.

What they are not, is sovereign airspace. If you shoot down an aircraft for being in an ADIZ, you're shooting it down in International airspace.

What an ADIZ is, is a section of international airspace (or even foreign airspace in Taiwan's case) where a nation has made it know that they will make an effort to identify any unknown aircraft entering. That's it. 

Very similar to Exclusive Economic Zones in the seas, where foreign vessels have the right to transit.

Freedom of Navigation flights and Freedom of Navigation cruises through contested areas are a regular occurrence by both our allies and rivals. Until someone crosses into sovereign waters or airspace, it's a non-story.

7306 Many of these so called fast boats used in the central American drug trade on both the Pacific and Caribbean sides are are shallow water vessels that are extremely unstable once they leave littoral zones. Once the crew is detained and evidence seized, the vessels cannot be left derelict, as they would then constitute a hazard to navigation. Vessels such as the Canadian MCDVs cannot take these apprehended boats in tow and remain sufficiently agile to continue their patrols. So at this distance from shore scuttling the fast boats becomes an operational imperative. In situations where the vessels are apprehended closer to shore. Seizing and towing to nearby ports to be impounded might be an option, but not in this case.

7313 Popski wouldn‚Äôt stand for this. Planes have to land and refuel. What you do is lighten jeeps as much as possible so that a heavy gun on a turret, a quarter tank of fuel, and three passengers are all it has to carry. The driver speeds through their airfield with the heavy gun shooting aircraft and fuel, while the third man handles nearby shooters for the short amount of time they‚Äôre in range. The North African Nazi air power was diminished with this tactic in North Africa during WWII. People say you can‚Äôt fight an Air Force without an Air Force. Popski pulled it off.

Given the evidence that the Iranian government was able to gather, it would be difficult to confirm the presence of a malicious AI application unless it was designed to be highly evasive.

7365 This keeps being news because people don't understand what Air Defence Identification Zones actually are and what they are not.

What they are not, is sovereign airspace. If you shoot down an aircraft for being in an ADIZ, you're shooting it down in International airspace.

What an ADIZ is, is a section of international airspace (or even foreign airspace in Taiwan's case) where a nation has made it know that they will make an effort to identify any unknown aircraft entering. That's it. 

Very similar to Exclusive Economic Zones in the seas, where foreign vessels have the right to transit.

7370 > In one scenario, Washington could use information gathered by the network to rule out the possibility of misidentifying the attacker who set off a nuclear blast. That might seem like an unnecessary step given the distinctiveness of a mushroom cloud. But if a weapon was delivered by a truck, tank or boat instead of a conspicuous missile with a trackable flight path, figuring out its origins might prove near impossible.

> For instance, Moscow could falsely claim that Kyiv set off a nuclear blast on the battlefield to try to draw the West into deeper war assistance. But in theory, with the sensor network in place, Washington would be able to point to its own nuclear attribution analyses to reveal that Moscow was in fact the attacker. Washington warned that the Kremlin was trying to create a false-flag pretext to escalate the war.

> The statement further said the base improvements were delivered in two main phases, with the first phase completed in summer 2021 to allow for the safe delivery of the first A-29 aircraft, which play a key role in Nigerian Air Force operations to combat violent extremist organisations, such as ISIS-West Africa and Boko Haram.

> The design of the engine shows that over the years, Iran has made significant efforts to acquire Western technology for its drones and missiles, despite widespread international sanctions.

> In 2006, Iran illegally purchased drone engines from the German company Limbach Flugmotoren.

> Three years after that, Iranian engineer Yousef Abutalebi announced that his company had created an engine for a UAV. According to CAR, the company appears to have tried to conceal its role in the creation of the Shahed drones.

Mass Spectrometer Cases Illustrate Diversity of Iranian Procurement Efforts
October 28, 2021

As Iran ramps up uranium enrichment, authorities in multiple countries have uncovered efforts by Iranian agents to procure mass spectrometers from abroad. These dual-use machines, which can precisely measure the purity and molecular structure of radioactive material, are essential for uranium enrichment. They also have a range of non-nuclear uses.

One recent case involved two individuals with ties to Canada and Iran who allegedly transshipped U.S.-origin spectrometers to Iran via the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A second case involved a German-Iranian national who allegedly shipped spectrometers directly from Germany to Iranian companies that had been sanctioned by the European Union for supporting Iran's nuclear program.

These cases, both opened in 2021, involve alleged transactions dating from 2015-2016 and 2019, respectively. The timing indicates that Tehran may have continued to use illicit means to further its uranium enrichment program even though the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) provided a licit procurement channel for such acquisitions. The cases also suggest that Iran still relies on ‚Äì or prefers ‚Äì Western-origin technology for its nuclear program, and they provide illustrative examples of the diverse sanctions evasion methods used to import items from Europe and North America into Iran.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7578 Thoughts that ATACAMS might make a surprise arrival during the counter offensive? 

I read an article awhile back that while the US didn‚Äôt want to escalade the situation and give a weapon with 300km range, another reason was following the HIMARS strikes Russia moved their equipment back 80km. 

If they were given ATACAMS too early Russia would figure out and plan around it. But if you shock and awe them in the counter offensive and all of their supply and sleeping quarters are blowing up, it makes it a lot more impactful. 

Unlikely they‚Äôre approved, but I‚Äôm somewhat hopeful.

7586 Digging in is kind of dangerous if your opponent has the ability to use \*precision\* fire. As that trench does about as much as the cope cage when the explosives are landing right there in that trench. 

Plus digging up a bunch of dirt stands out like a sore thumb all the way to the orbit with the right kind of optics. 

But I suppose the alternative for them would be running back all the way to russia as they cant do manoeuvre warfare to even save their lives. So they dig their graves and sit them waiting for Ukraine to press the button to end them.

7587 > anti-tank ditches

Maybe somebody should look into a specialized solution to fill in those ditches under combat conditions?

Three ideas that come to mind:

- A fleet of remote controlled mini-dump trucks carrying earth to fill in the ditch, avoiding enemy fire through speed, maneuverability and numbers
- A "engineering tank" with its gun replaced with earth-moving equipment for filling in the ditch
- A bunch of flat panels air-dropped into a ditch to function as a bridge, that have robotic legs so they can orient themselves, engage supports, or even move to another location when they hit the ground

+1 for futuristic, smart air-defense looks, -1 for making me think of Skynet.

>The Skynex unit can use several medium-range radars, such as the Oerlikon X-TAR3D Tactical Acquisition Radar, to provide the air picture, which is consolidated in the control node. The weapon systems of the Skynex can include Oerlikon Revolver Gun Mk3, the Oerlikon Twin Gun GDF009 TREO, surface-to-air missiles, means for active and passive electronic warfare and future high-energy lasers can be integrated.

>The basic configuration of the Skynex System consists of a control node with the Oerlikon Skymaster Battle Management System, the medium-range Oerlikon X-TAR3D Search Radar, and up to four remote-controlled Oerlikon Revolver Guns Mk3. Depending on the size of the defended asset the basic Skynex System can easily be expanded with additional sensors and effectors.

>The unmanned Revolver Gun Mk3 combines exceptional precision with high firepower, firing up to 1,000 rounds per minute. Against aerial targets, the 35mm cannon has a maximum firing range of 3,500 m and 5,000 for land targets. With its own sensor unit, consisting of a tracking radar, a TV and an IR camera as well as laser range finders, the gun can take over any in-range air targets assigned by Skymaster and autonomously track and engage such targets. Using the programmable 35mm Ahead ammunition, the gun is able to hit even the smallest targets.

7671 What is the state of anti-drone systems in the field? Cheap quadcopters for surveillance or bombing have seemingly seen a lot of success in the trenches, but what is being done to defend against them? 

Searching online I see some products like drone detection sensors that can detect any drones flying around, before humans would spot them. And of course there are jamming or hijacking equipment. But are these in common use? Do every squad carry them, or is it hardly used at all, or something in between? 

If it's not widely used, why not? Does it cost too much, is it not very effective, or are drones not much of a threat anyway?

7689 A research rocket launched by Sweden Space Corp early on Monday from Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden malfunctioned and landed 15 km (9.32 miles) inside neighbouring Norway.  
The rocket reached an altitude of 250 km where experiments were carried out in zero gravity, the agency said in a statement.  
"It landed in the mountains at 1,000 meters altitude, and 10 kilometers from the closest settlement," Philip Ohlsson, head of communications at SSC, told Reuters on Tuesday.

7690 It's hard to build a rocket when the instructions have no words and the only tool you get is an allen wrench 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7691 A couple of years ago I was up at Esrange (the swedish space station). One of the emplyees there told us about this exact possibility (I think that it has happened before?). Anyways he said that for these types of missions they don't take the earths rotation into account when calculating the rocket trajectory. For such a short flight that's usually fine but they will always hit slightly further west than planned. He said this is intentional as they'd much rather hit Norway than Finland. 

This is because the norweigian border is just a mountain range (no people) while the finish border has a river (more people).

7711 Nuclear Disarmament
Canada‚Äôs operation of nuclear weapons was controversial throughout the Cold War, and the topic remained a closely guarded national secret. Officials never confirmed nor denied the presence of nuclear weapons on Canadian military bases. Canada is generally considered to be the first nation to have voluntarily given up its nuclear weapons. Systems were deactivated beginning in 1968 and continuing until 1984. (See Disarmament.) Canada maintains the technological capability to develop nuclear weapons. Canada also remains protected by the American nuclear umbrella and the nuclear weapons of its NATO allies.

7739 > "We have not had any communication from the rover since it entered hibernation. "We are monitoring it every day and believe it has not woken up because the sunlight has not yet reached the minimum level for power generation," Zhang told China's CGTN adding that the rover has already completed 358 Martian days of exploration before it hibernated.

"It's not dead. It's resting." 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7740 The rover died because it depended on solar power.

The US has sent 4 probes to mars and learned its lesson after the first two probes. Solar is not the way forward for space travel, because for every linear unit distance away from the sun you need not the same amount of surface area, not even double, but rather square of surface area to meet the same power generation as you would have on earth. 

Earth is 2/3 the distance between Mars and the Sun. A fixed solar panel from earth would not generate 2/3 the electrical power on Mars but (2/3)^2 or 4/9 the power‚Äî under ideal conditions. But add in the Mars atmosphere and dust on the ground, solar is simply not practical for power on mars.

The remaining two space probes that the US has sent use RTG generators which is a type of nuclear power. Decaying plutonium isotope generates heat which is harnessed as a power source that lasts for centuries. This is the way forward for space travel and it‚Äôs a shame that China did not pick up the lessons learned from the NASA missions.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7787 That really doesn't sound like a lot.

1m rounds is what, a single mag per each of the thirty something thousand Russian soldiers currently in Ukraine?

300K shells is a lot, but they are as good as their accuracy and the batteries' resiliency against counter-battery fire. I remember seeing reports that Russian artillery barrels were being so overused that their accuracy was off by half a kilometer.

Not to mention the HIMARS have put Russia on edge re: their supply depots and have had to place them further away from the front than they'd like. That makes logistics a nightmare. What good are shells if they aren't getting into artillery barrels?

Overall, I'm not sure what this is going to do to materially improve Russia's current situation. Compare this to what the US and friends are sending Ukraine and it's not even in the same league. Bradleys are already stalking Ukrainian fields looking for armor to send a tow missile towards.

7834 Things are really heating up it seems, we might be approaching the climax of the war afterall. Or maybe it's just recency bias but between all the strikes carried out by both sides lately I really get the feeling that they're both ready to make the coming phase of the war the decisive one.

7835 Feels like the Russian arsenal currently consists only of glide bombs according to the subreddit. Big crater? Glide bomb. Air strike? Glide bomb. Unspecified explosion several kilometres away? Glide bomb.

7845 For comparison, in the battle of Verdun the Germans fired over 300,000 shells per day. Obviously modern artillery is more accurate, but it is crazy how much greater a weight of fire the armies of a century ago were able to sustain.

7862 As much as I love my boys, this is a stupid idea, the ERA will be more dangerous that a regular cage. If a javelin comes in whilst the crew has it's hatches open the ERA's explosion will overpressure the tank. They may as well use regular cage armour as that has been shown to be effective against RPGs and AT4s in urban warfare and also various kamikaze drones in the UA arsenal.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
7864 Each element carries about .3 kg of RDX, usually the elements are flush mounted and can therefore not trigger each other. With this great Soviet engineering technique you will have great fun whenever you're actually being hit and gotta run, opening that hatch becomes an extra adrenaline kick.

There is no way the Western Ukrainians can win against that sort of ordinance.

7903 This war has showed us things we couldn‚Äôt even have imagined. Sure, many of us knew war movies were bullshit, but what strikes me most is just how inglorious and random the terror and death all is.

How do you even function as a person after this? What does it feel like to shoot somebody in the face point blank while you tread over arms and legs and guts? Obviously adrenaline plays a big role but still. Kinda explains the insta-cry from war vets when they are asked about a certain thing. To continue living you must need to compartmentalize all this stuff, just lock it away in a dark room in your mind.

7904 This might be the most carnage I‚Äôve seen in one video in the sense that every square foot seems to have a different body, or body part, or blown up vehicle, or destroyed defensive structure.

7952 While I'm on the fence as far as if this was shot down by a patriot, the pro rus crowd seems to still have a fundamental misunderstanding about how ballistic missiles work, and how patriots work. The Patriot system was designed for this very engagement. It seems people think this thing is hugging the terrain and dodging fire. It isn't. Not to mention that they probably detected the plane that launched it before it was fired.

8001 After seeing this, I doubt that any large scale counter offensive has any chance of success without suffering huge losses. The sky constantly watches movements on the ground now. Without blitzkrieg or element of surprise, any troops deployment spot is as good as sitting ducks target. Once the air defense is crippled, bombers can flatten any large scale ground threats quickly.

8008 Yeah no, I'll believe it if more info comes out. Not saying impossible but extremely unlikely a hypersonic missile can be shot down by Ukraine unless they got some supersecret new tech system by one of the allies.

And it's a smart move to make, if Wagner gets crushed there by the UA offensive, it loses all the credibility it's gaining, if they pull out for a "reason" such as this, they save face.

8059 There‚Äôs this semi-scandal in the MoD over the ‚Äúmisallocation‚Äù of tons of shells to Wagner.  It looks like it was probably by some sort of corruption. Wagner was getting supplied massive amounts of munitions earlier on to the point that it was sapping the munitions from actual RU units. Wagner blew through the munitions and MoD culled back their ammo under the assumption that they should still have artillery from when they were getting way too much.

8153 Or more likely, it's an [Luch Korsar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luch_Korsar), very similar tail design.

Edit: it's super hard to see the difference with basically only silhouette as reference. Luch has retractable wheels which bayraktar does not. Could be malfunctioning, who knows. The tail both have 90¬∞ angle. Wings is hard to see the difference due to perspective. I'm at 50/50 right now...

Edit 2:
It sure looks like Bayraktar, looking at the bulge (probably cameras and whatnot) at the drones belly. That bulge does not exist on the Luch Korsar as far as I know..

8175 Really dumb. At that range you have almost no chance of hitting it, and an even bigger chance of the bullets landing and hitting someone. Leave it up to the dedicated AA.

8183 Yeah I never, never, NEVER assume I'll do better in the same situation. How many decorated combat veterans in the past hundred years still trembled or even pissed themselves every time they heard fireworks decades after they served?

8188 Interesting. This is the first, or at least one of the first, times that we‚Äôve seen a Lancet used on a ‚Äúlowly‚Äù APC/IFV. Most past targets have always been higher value stuff

8193 I think we have only seen less than half a dozen successful strikes with these flying garbage cans 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8194 Switchblade 300 wouldn‚Äôt have done much if they hit it too 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8195 1. First of all, [the switchblade did explode](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/137yzwg/russian_9k33_osa_gets_hit_by_a_switchblade300/?ref=share&ref_source=link). The tiny warhead leaves the bulk of the drone intact. 

2. The Switchblade 300 is meant as a recon asset and for low-collateral targeting of insurgents. It's not going to do much against vehicles. 

3. The cost per drone is roughly $6000 ($60k for 10). While is much more expensive than the weaponized quadcopters, it's pretty dirt cheap for the US military. 

There is a new version entering production (Switchblade 300 Block 20) which shows the intended use quite well. No changes were made to the warhead, instead increasing loitering time, camera quality, increasing datalink jam-resistance. It is essentially meant to act as a recon asset and used for spotting and artillery correction in heavy EW environments were DJI's are not effective. The warhead is more for when the battery is running low or to snipe a random time-critical personal target.

8200 Guys, there is a bunch of drone systems out there that use the V tale. Many chinese drones. Also, a TB2 wouldn't be flying that low, its not a suicide drone. It has stand off capabilities, even the Russian's would know this. But i doubt they managed to capture a working TB2 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8201 Confirmed by UA that it was TB2 after losing control over it. 

Fog of war example at it's best. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8202 I thought it was odd i didn't hear the lawnmower sound from the drone. Now i figured out why. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8203 That makes a lot more sense and explains why it wasn't doing anything but fly straight 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8204 If true it could simply have been a software malfunction.  It may have simply disconnected from the controller which is a common issue and occurrence.  Having guns on the ground take pot shots at it, probably as they did not know, is not the optimal way to down it.    That drone is to big to snare with a net (although America may have systems that can do just that) but it certainly could have been brought down more elegantly IMHO. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8205 Press F to Doubt

They probably don't even have that many built, yet alone operational in any sense. 

Based on information, they have only one TEL since there were two, but one was given to Saudi Arabia (and hasn't been given back yet). Also, possibly the project was canceled due to lack of funding. So, they might only have a few missiles that were supposed to be used during the testing phase. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment

8209 Took them a solid 20+ min to shoot down their own drone which they lost connection to 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8210 What‚Äôs that wire loop visible in camera? Some kind of crude contact switch? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8211 This is very embarrassing and expensive. Using a $100k missile to shoot down your own multi-million $ drone is not awesome.  I understand they had no choice but they should have a maintenance or test regime to prevent this out-of-control from happening. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8212 Oh no ... It turns out that if you shoot down air targets over cities, then they ... fall on cities ... Who would have thought? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8213 For those wondering what it is, it is a protection unit from MANPADS, originally developed for the presidential plane (hence the export name of the system - PresidentS), now there are modifications for Mi-8, Mi-26, Ka-50/52 and Su-25. It works in the following way: the system detects a missile launch by thermal pattern, then it activates 4 independent defense complexes - emission of heat traps, radar dipole reflectors, setting of active electronic and IR jamming. 

In 2015 there were tests when 20 consecutive MANPADs were launched against Mi-8, all of them were repelled.

8214 it worked (but not every time), like that crazy helicopters rush to Hostomel facing many MANPADs video.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8225 For those wondering how this compares to bradleys   
BMP is faster, more tactically and strategically mobile, and better armed(100mm cannon vs 25mm cannon,faster than bradley by about 20kmph, 9 tons lighter to bradley) The Bradley is much better armored and also probably more comfortable based on the designed of prior BMPs. I would rather be in the Bradley purely because of its extensive armor packages. The BMP outshines it in all other aspects though. So yeah you are much safer in Bradley but BMP-3 is likely more lethal.

8247 Got to love all the weapon experts on this sub. Modern AD like the IRIS-T have a dead angle, since the aircraft was not marked a threat till they lost control over the city, they could not use the same weapons system they'd use on ALCMs. Most likely the information regarding the loss of control was shared, the aircraft was therefore not marked an immediate threat and they tried to take it down whilst minimizing possible civilian casualites (e.g. not fking it up with MPADS right away).

8342 I think the mid air explosion is the first hit. There is a second attack on the same flag pole that hit the base of the pole and left fires burning. 


So either the AA was so successful it diverted the drone to hit the same spot twice. Or the AA was asleep and the UA hit the same spot twice.

Goto 0:24. top left of the biggest extension of the cloud of smoke... rewind to 0:20 and check that area.

edit: rephrased; and it looks like at least one person got blown off the feet by the blast.

Also tracks look fresh. Dark with strong contrast.

8348 Nice hit but it hit the front of the turret ERA and the composite armour of the turret. if the lancet dudes want results against tanks, hit the roof sides engine deck not the front armour

8360 Kinda shows the value of fully enclosed and armored SPGs. Krab or akatsiya wouldve probably only  taken minor damage, whilst this CAESAR is (or was) in need of a long and expensive repair. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8361 Was this Caesar hit by aerial bombardment?

The damage look to be from a large HE blast (little fragmentation, no fire damage) but Lagoons National park (nearest land near Snake Island) is out of reach from Russian artillery and drone bombs are too small and would require a direct hit to make damage. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8362 Mhm, they somehow found a completally flat spot on fucking snake island, aswell as they transported caesar artillery onto the island which doesnt make sence to do at all 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8363 Does the Caesar even have range to reach Snake Island? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Island_(Ukraine)

>The closest Ukrainian city is Vylkove, 50 km (31 mi); however, there also is a port Ust-Dunaisk, 44 km (27 mi) away from the island.

Range of Caesar is 42km with rocket assisted shells. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAESAR_self-propelled_howitzer

Closest communicated point to move stuff easily is 45.391663, 29.654747 ; It is 45.5km away.

So sounds unlikely. to be doing anything on snake island.

8371 I wonder about the two people climbing the dome on the left. It's too early to change the flag, were they sent there to be a lookout for the drones after the first one exploded? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8372 Strange. Looks like it explodes in the air, like interception to me, but camera doesn‚Äôt seem to pick up any interceptor and the explosion seem to come outwards from the drone, without any direction blast to suggest interception. I guess three possibilities (ruling out false flag or whatever other cooky suggestions are floating about)

Last second intercept from something not caught in camera.

Detonated in the air deliberately (seems to be full of combustible stuff, trying to start a fire maybe?)

Or clipped that flag pole. Flag pole could also be the target, and with the May 9th celebration stuff right in front that would be understandable.

Could also have detonated in the air by accident I guess but? How and why would that happen? Interesting times anyway. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment

8397 The article says that the russian ships were in the baltic sea in june at the time of the NATO exercise. So there could be multiple reason why they were there at this time. One could be to observe the NATO exercise. Or let us think they were around to observe the exercise, while they were actually planting bombs (which the article not says, but implies). Who knows.

That there were also a ship a few days before the explosions in the area. That looks suspicious. 

The article claims it has good evidence for 3 (maybe 4) ships that were in the area (in june and september combined), but also talks about other news articles which claims much more ships in this timeframe. The question is how common or uncommon are these "ghostships" in the baltic sea. the more common they are, the less quality the theory in the article has.

Its an interesting article. thanks.

8420 Isn't IRIS-T an infrared system. So it is basically not that useful against targets like drones, guided bombs or rockets.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8469 Wagner acting like this is some super secret stash of modern weapons.

AFAIK the vast majority of this stuff has been there since the fall of the Soviet Union and the majority is WW2 lend lease that the Soviets stored away in the 1960s. They are probably telling the truth about numbers, there probably are tens of thousands of weapons and millions of rounds of ammo down there but what condition is it in?

Salt mines can be great locations for long term storage and most of those guns are probably in fine working order under all the cosmoline. But why bother spending the time and money to bring them to readiness when factory new M4s are cheaper and ready to go out of the box.
Personally I wouldn't trust the ammo because of its age alone. The Soledar salt mines are about 60% humidity year around and that's not ideal for long term ammo storage if not seal in air tight containers.

I suspect the Ukrainians stripped it of everything that was immediately useful and if rumors are true planned on demoing the rest. For whatever reason they didn't or failed to blow it and now Wagner has control.

If you are willing to trust a 9 year old western source the Guardian says "at least 1 million weapons" as of 2014. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/protesters-ukraine-weapons-cache-mine

And yes, I know, T3 are all over the territories of the former COMECON, so seeing them elsewhere is not really exceptional. What with Tatra having been the designated tram builder for the whole communist world, back when new build trams looked like this. Still. At least these specimens have been recently polished and washed: the usual T3 in former Soviet territories nowadays has as many rust holes as windows. At least they made an effort to make these ones look nice.

8512 80% of ‚Äúfootage‚Äù out there are worthless. There are literally propaganda departments employing thousands of ppl on both sides‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt even bother keeping it secret. 

Be very skeptical about any footages unless corroborated or if they are minimally edited high quality footage showing both sides without any cuts.

Let time be the judge, whatever outcome in 2-3 years time is the only thing that matters. Defensive positions, supply lines, air defence, troop rotation/morale/quality and industrial output are more important than haggling over who lost more troops in bakhmut lol. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8513 Doesn't matter. Oryx probably already documented this as a T90M kill. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8514 Lol, busted. There is so much of this bs..

Is this ‚Äòdestroyed‚Äô t-90m already on Oryx? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8515 Wow! What a great breakdown. It had me fooled but I think it‚Äôs because:

a) I‚Äôm fairly ignorant to military/war stuff. I find it interesting but hardly knowledgeable. They play on my ignorance.
b) the information space is flooded with content, making expensive and hard to parse.

8516 How the f can the video be reversed if the tanks gets visibly blown up. That makes no sense whatsoever 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8517 Damn, I hate when stuff gets faked. Don‚Äôt understand the logic if it. Even if this was real, most people will forget about the tank anyways within a few days. This is almost as bad as the Russians claiming that they destroyed Bradley‚Äôs and leopards already. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8518 So we can post YouTube "expert" videos now? I like redeffect but this still just a video from a military  enthusiast. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8519 Oh wow, so some guy faked a T-90 being blown up.

That's shitty.

Anyways, haven't a bunch of these tanks been destroyed in other places? They have no defenses that the T-72s don't have, but they do have the same autoloader and chassis so they will almost certainly get destroyed all the same. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8520 You might be right about this video, idk why they would do it. There is already videos of T90M being destroyed. Just in visually confirmed losses on Oryx 14 T90M,35 T90A, 1 T90AK, and 7 T90S have been lost by Russia. If they doctored a video about T14 or something, then i could understand.

8643 9 months and they still haven't taken this *enormous* city of... 75,000.

The Iraqi army was able to clear Mosul, a city of 1.5 MILLION, in less time than it's taken Russia to get to this far. LoL The IRAQI military cleared a city 10 TIMES as large as Bakhmut. **The IRAQI Military LoL!!!** Not to mention most of the city was not only still standing, but many parts went untouched from the ravages of war. They didn't need to level the place building by building, block by block, to clear out an enemy that could blend in by just setting down their weapon. Think about that. A military that was less capable, even with the wests air support, than what the Russians currently are was able to clear a city that could house more than 10 times what Bakhmut could.

8666 That's definitely not a plant, that's a storage facility (probably military) for explosives, from the layout:

https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B035'01.2%22N+35%C2%B051'03.2%22E/@48.5836702,35.848314,1046m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d48.5836667!4d35.8508889

The buildings are spread out wide, and most of them have berms around them, also there is a defensive parameter, and only one access road. It's possible they have been storing booster parts there, but definitely not a plant of any kind.

Edit: The plant area is south-west of that, also a larger, spread-out area, closer to the railway station, and the road leading to it. A lot of it looks like it has been neglected, or run-down for a long time. There you can see some tanks, and buildings for some kind of production, etc. But apparently that's not where the explosion is supposed to have happened, according to the OP image.

8687 The secondary explosion, alone, means SOMETHING big went up. The very fact that they were flying flights immediately after makes it seem as if they were testing if that was possible just after it happened. But go on with your "we know" stuff.

8690 I remember a program I watched about a guy who had all this earth scanning gear and he would go to famous WW2 battle sights, scan the area and find all sorts of things like trenches, bunkers, underground tunnels even bullet and bomb impacts on an old military runway. It was some kind of 3d scanning tech, really fancy stuff but I would think something like that would be helpful. I've also seen a video where Ukranian military place mines then GPS tag them.

8698 I hear the French Cesar self propelled artillery guns are doing way better than most other models of artillery. They have air bag tires that are much lighter than caterpillar tracks and much less likely to get stuck in mud. And they can drive away in only seconds after firing a few shells making them much harder to send a lancet drone after. Of all the artillery the NATO has sent to Ukraine, a far higher percentage of French Caesars are still in operation than any other type.

8699 Wasn't there much damage? 9.5bn seems pretty cheap given that Russia was bombing it pretty heavily. I'd have thought 95bn would be more in the balk park

8717 How many residential buildings attacked I wonder. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8718 So if they shoot down 83% of the missiles, they need to shoot 13 missiles at each target to ensure a 90% hit probability. There's no way russia can keep up with that.

It's important to diminish Ukrainian AD for the upcoming offensive. That way FABs can get to work if Ukraine is silly enough to pull through with it.

8775 Valveless pulse jet. The easiest method of getting thrust on a jet drive that even British can do it without a licence (wink Colin wink). And no unless you have industries like Nazis had back in the day. Its stupid to turn this to a bomb. because in a homegrown pulse jet flyer like V1. you need 2 months to weld it together. So its more for propaganda. Even if ukraine has an industry for a contraption better use that industry to make more drone warfare not this...

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8813 i want to see some MRSI action at the receiving end. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8814 As far as i can tell, it does not seem like they were using the MRSI "Multiple rounds simultaneous impact" feature of the PZH-2000 here. A feature which is a big improvement for shoot&scoot tactics, as they can start retreating as the shells start impacting.

Since that would entail shifting the barel to achieve a different trajectory arch for every next shot... and I didn't see the barrel shift for consecutive shots.

Is there a reason for when that wouldn't be desirable, aside from having to fire at absolute maximum range, where a different arch wouldn't reach the target..?

I assume here then, that they either did not employ it due to difficulties, do not have the training and know-how to employ the feature (shouldn't be too difficult, it's supposed to calculate it itself), did not have a clear target beyond lobbing shells in an aproximate area.. Or they fire at maximum range and can not use it.

Am i missing any other possible reasons?

8841 Is that the maingun from a BTR 80 he‚Äôs using? üò≥

8842 He's making a case for more ammunition. 

Take it with a grain of salt. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8843 The ammunition problem seems to be consistent and real. I hope they can get to the bottom of it soon.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the KIA is what he says it is ‚Äî they‚Äôre attacking difficult positions held by fierce fighters that are well equiped. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8844 That‚Äôs a big improvement for them to have a KIA-to-meter-ratio below 1 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8845 One guy for a meter. God they take less than the height of a body per death. Sounds a little to expensive considering KIA must be higher since the regular russian army already helps the dying Wagner group. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8846 so almost 1 soldier for every meter that‚Äôs one way to do it i guess 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8847 94 KIA + x2+ wounded btw i hope its more like x4 wounded. Insane

8848 The Institute for the Study of War says the Wagner "culminated" in the beginning of January, and not gonna make any significant gains since then.

8850 None of us watch this TV. I find it convenient that it cut off so short, so for me it lacks context.

I imagine it was an editorial mistake where someone screwed up and put the wrong wreckage footage due to deadlines and poor QA practices.

8851 Those Gvozdika's blow up real good.

Seriously though, I saw the video of the Lancet hitting one and once the ammo got lit it was a big explosion. 

Looking at the above video, it doesn't look like the tracked Gvozdika.

8876 The comments in these drone videos are always a fine example of how low humans can go and how irrational the cheerleading can get when you take into consideration they come from people not involved in the war in any way, shape or form. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8877 Its not just bad training when it comes to tourniquets, Russian standard Esmarch Tourniquets are very simple and a lot harder to apply than standard western or newer Russian ones. They are essentially just straps to wrap around the limb and tighten by pulling hard, which is difficult to do right with the correct amount of pressure, especially when self administered. Modern turniquets have a leaver thats twisted, making it much easier to fine tune the pressure until no pulse is left in the wounded limb and the bleeding stops. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8878 very believable

when an attack fails you cannot necessarily take back your wounded men 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8879 Did a few tours in Iraq, the biggest lesson we learned in combat lifesaver training is to stop the bleeding. The #1 cause of battlefield fatalities isn't the wound itself so much as bleeding out.

8893 He have 2 rpo-2 bumblebee with him lol how his a civilian? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8894 Definitely should be investigated.

Can we verify who was doing the shooting? And is there unedited full footage that perhaps shows why he was targeted?  With both sides having supply issues, I can't see them wasting shots on a civilian. Could be wrong though.  War brings out the worst in people.

Is that an [RPG](https://i.imgur.com/e9IpBed.jpg) in the boat? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8895 There is a green helmet in his boat what a interesting civilian‚Ä¶

8896 Does that tube behind the ‚Äúfisherman‚Äù have a pistol grip? What is that object on the other side of the boat that resembles a bowling pin?

8897 Didn‚Äôt the guy actually hit a mine while trying to surrender after seeing drone? I read, he was in boat looking for  bodies with id tags. Not sure.

 This is a doctored video. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8907 Dude had a rocket grenade by his shin,  rocket launcher behind him and a green helmet in the back. Also, that's a pretty big explosion for anything a drone carries. To me it looks like he hit a mine or possibly artillery, but the explosion coming out from the water upwards really seems like a mine. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8908 If it's just a "civilian" why does he have a white armband with a "Z" on it at 0:37?

8911 idk, it could be a good shoot but who knows. there‚Äôs clearly a helmet in the boat which is odd, and some other items that look like they might‚Äôve been weapons. impossible to say really.

8913 Man sails through warzone with what appears to be a rocket launcher and helmet in his boat.  Admittedly it‚Äôs hard to tell, but that never stopped anyone before.  The operator is left with two choices.  Let him go, and potentially he harms their comrades later, or take him out.

8927 Yes, it's insufficient. Send EVERYTHING. All the Aircraft Carriers, all the Submarines, all the F-15s, F-16s, ... basically all the Fs possible, all the everything. And then some! Because they still won't have enough. So in the end NATO decided to give only one thing: the one big F.

8932 Guys, just zoom in on that picture. Look at the flag. There is red spilling over the edge of the flag. Look at the arms. They seem to be cropped and placed there, then finally the first guy to your right, look at his weapon, somehow it is being supported by an invisible force. Cmon, guys, you can't be serious.

8936 What a surprise. They didn‚Äôt lose any submarines, didn‚Äôt use their nuclear force and held most of their airforce back because losses were too expensive.

So of course it‚Äôs not all in ruins. Who said that, ever?

Still their land forces didn‚Äôt perform, suffered huge losses and is in bad shape.

8943 and the fuel like that will burn a few hours 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8944 So, after some thinking about it.. Maybe it's right...

The fact is simple: huge explosion which looks like a lot of rocket fuel also burned up. 

Russia used 8 ballistic missiles to strike... 

Wait what? Russia used 8 ballistic missiles on an old factory?  That does sound a bit excessive, In the past I never saw more than two ballistic strikes on a single target.

8946 can someone explain why so many missles even miss? i know there are internal guidance systems that are now more than 50 years old and are reliable so if they really had issues with chips they could use such a system but apparently its some other issue. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8947 Apparently, they are reporting this is the result of a drone wave of 10, in which 9 were shot down or disabled. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8948 From a firefighting point of view, is there anything that can be done about it? Like, is the idea just let it burn out and contain it, or can it actually be put out to save the infrastructure and oil? 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8949 Does not matter that much, there is still severe damage to this site and much of the fuel stored inside is gone now. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8950 Easy target for a drone.   Underground fuel storage will need to become more common everywhere. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8951 It looks a bit more like a T-62M, maybe T-62M1; the extra armor on the T-55s was only really used by other Warsaw Pact states that weren't given the T-62. Interesting to see that they don't seem to modify the T-62s as much as claimed. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
8952 An additional armor plate was pierced in which there are layers of steel and rubber.

The main frontal armor plate was not damaged.

This is T-62M.

They are used as artillery pieces, and as you can see, this makes sense even considering the not-so-precise smooth-bore gun of this tank.

Any other self-propelled artillery would have been destroyed as it has anti-bullet armor.

8961 Is that the new SRLS or why is there only one rocket impact? To my knowledge those are no high precision weapons but rather convice by area of effect damage. A full salvo is said to cover 200x400m, so a single blast has about 30-35m kill radius on an open field under good conditions? Just wondering about the effectiveness of firing a single rocket.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9016 "This ATGM is an Iranian copy of the Russian Kornet-EM ATGM, one of the characteristic differences of which are the red stripes on the TPK, indicating the thermobaric warhead of the 9M133FM-2 missile. Similar red stripes are used by Iran to mark Toophan (copy BGM-71 TOW) and Saeghe (copy M47 Dragon) thermobaric missiles.

At the moment, it is not known for certain whether this is a consequence of direct deliveries from Iran for the RF Armed Forces, or a case of "retrophying" these missiles from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which got there from Iranian ships captured by the NATO fleet with arms shipments for Yemen."

9022 thats those blow out panels at work though. impressive design. the crew were probably mostly unharmed thanks to those panels. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9023 How is it they would be able to get photos after bombing it? Wouldn't there be infantry associated with its deployment? Yes, likely a bunch got killed, but this is either at the front where it is accessible to photograph, or if not then having a photo such as this becomes suspect.

9027 I‚Äôm as pro-Ukraine as anyone, but the idea that this system impacted the Gepard - with thin armour and full of sensitive radar and tracking equipment - without effect is ridiculous.

9028 Time will tell but from the video it didn't look like it took much damage. I'm more interested in the fact that so many AA assets have been moved closer to line of contact. This counteroffensive really must be imminent

9030  That Lancet missed the hit, it actually exploded to the side of the vehicle. Seems they have some latency issues to resolve on the Lancet communication. At best they scratched paint.

9034 Guys, if it wasn't a good hit we would have Ukrainian footage showing that they missed.

Accept that one Gepard got fucked and move on.

It'll be the same when western MBTs get destroyed, no weapon system in invincible.

Edit : After looking closely the video it seems that it wasn't that much of a clean hit, probably still fucked but not as hard as I thought. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9035 Some people seemed watching too much Hollywood stuff. You don't need a vehicle to end up in a beautiful fireball to disable it, and the damage from the explosion is not all about that fireball but the sharpnels.  
While the explosion seems small, that tracking radar sure is done and the barrels are filled with sharpnels. Hull and other electronics/ optical device maybe damaged too. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9036 This post is some great evidence for how garbage the populace of this sub has become.  First, many called it fake.  Now that it's real, they're all saying it missed or the thin armor of a Gepard is actually made of avengerium and the shaped charge bounced off.  Plus spalling damage apparently doesn't exist.

9050 I'm not sure how much damage a light drone is going to be able to do to heavy armor.

Although I have to wonder why the Gepard wasn't defending itself against the drone.

9051 Likely a miss.
No parts flying, lots of dust, No visible damage, crosshair off center.

9052 Hard to say how much damage. Looks very little and very repairable. Probably is going to be the like the aftermath of the m777 where it did absolutely nothing but spread soot. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9053 Since I saw all of those, really detailed decoys of S300, on these photos yesterday. Some how this ‚ÄúGepard‚Äù just look like one of those. So I would not be surprise, if it turns out to be a decoy in the end. If so, could be the start, for the counter offensive, an expensive way of getting rid of the Lancet, but a way.  

If I am wrong here, well I‚Äôm not an expert. And a big success for the Russian Forces. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment

There is no big explosion because there are only bullets‚Ä¶. High likely the left gun and radar destroyed, it‚Äôs needs to go back to the shop for repair

9056 Is there a different video showing this?  This video turns to look the other way when about to film what I think should be the impact site and I‚Äôd like to see it.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9071 Lots of videos where they are just scratching paint or hitting just to the side of the target like the Gepard and the one S300 launcher. All the leftover smoke is from the drone itself in these videos. The Lancet warhead is pretty weak, relatively speaking. Seen ONE video where a Lancet actually hit an S300 rocket and the rocket fuel going off. Ukraine is moving their overall Surface-to-Air coverage forward for the upcoming assault, dangerous movement, hence the handful of vids we are seeing.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9144 This video has made me question some things. I remember last year we had a video of a Russian soldier shooting at an abandoned UA S300 from a PKM at a distance of roughly 40m which caused a huge explosion that stopped the filming as it was approaching the camera, sometime later on we got an aftermath video depicting the scorched body of the alleged soldier. However, here we can clearly see that a presumably fully loaded S300 does not have that much of a great blast radius as the trees and the grass in the vicinity do not seem scorched or even scathed. So.... was the aftermath of the aformentioned video fake or was there something else at play there? My guess would be that a trailing undetonated rocket from the system ended at the guy's location.

2)why are the providing zero proof or even a single one of the over hundred photos the claim too have

3)why are they so vague on details, like "it was in area of Nordstream" with not even rough estimates on actual distance or anything substantive 

I'll wait till they substantiate their claims a bit better before concluding anything. 

We know a Russian mini-Sub carrier/crane ship was part of a small fleet that left Russia's Kalingrad port 4 days before Nordstream blew up. That's it. 

Worth mentioning they leave that port routinely and pass in "the area of Nordstream" frequently depending on what your definition of the unclarified "area of Nordstream" is that they keep refering too without clarification.

This has the same energy as the school dropout who always talks about his PTSD and how he killed 3 people with his bare hands but he never mentions that he has never seen a battlefield and that he was a cook at a safe and warm army barrack 1000s of KMs away from the next warzone.

9171 Why would they film this?
I get wanting to pay your respects to the soldier(who deserves every bit of respect for his sacrifice); but why would they want to film it and pose and talk into the camera?!

These guys, ‚ÄúMarines‚Äù, are given weapons and allowed to play soldier around the world. Imagine that.

9174 Suits walking next to military equipment. Such a classic picture and it sums up NATOs "help".

9175 More hardware without any networks, this will do so good on the battlefield.  A mosh posh of American, British, Polish, German hardware and they're expecting it all to just "link" up.  That's not how any of this stuff works.  

It's an absolute joke at this point, continue to ship trash to Ukraine so their boys can get killed in them.  I guess it's good for the shareholders of Raytheon, Grumman, General Electric, etc.  Great work guys, TO THE LAST UKRAINIAN!

9176 UA POV First footage of the 37th Brigade working with AGS-20 APKWS, which are laser-guided 70mm rockets, typically used against targets when you wish to limit collateral damage. Can be used in AA role as well. Range is 5km

9178 I'll bet they are not building decoys like the NATO.

The NATO should expect them Rooskies to out manufacture then by a 100 to 1 ratio. And subsequently fire on a 100 to 1 ratio.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9181 This one also has a damaged tube. A lot of wear and tear or damage from artillery on ukranian S300s they cant repair? I mean, they could be used as a no longer useful decoys due to damage, but using old S300 for that with a crew to trade it for 1 Lancet would be a terrible trade. Especially if they are still loaded with rockets.

9182 Was it not loaded or something 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9183 Multiple videos of two truck convoys? That‚Äôs operationally terrible. Who would send out S-300s in twos?? And both of them have half a tube conveniently uncovered for the drone to spot. And no huge explosions that we know S-300s disintegrate with??

I don‚Äôt buy this one bit. These are decoys to waste the drones.

9210 At 0:44 the pilot appears to be using the HUD to target the rockets. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9211 I always wonder with these sorties, it always look like they could carry more. Like in this specific video, it looks like they only loaded the pods with 2 rockets/pod when they can load 5 max. And then they sortie in a 2-plane formation. So in total it looks like they are lobbing 8 rockets (4 per plane) on this mission. Why go through the trouble of flying 2 aircraft if you are lobbing just 8 rockets? Just load 8 into one plane and save an airframe and fuel? And then if you need to send in 2 planes (either for training, survivability, or redundancy), why send them with piece-meal ordinance? Fully load them to the hill. Load 5 rockets on the pods, heck there are 4 more free hardpoints, give the SU25 full bear with 30 rockets. There's no kill like overkill. Why so stingy with the weapons? Especially on dumb ordinance that requires saturation to be effective. Makes no sense.

 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9233 First of all, Gepard will not even fart after struck with lancet. These lancets can - occasionally - inflict some damage on weakly armored stuff, and when lucky they can ignite ammunition inside, but there are just a few documented successful strikes like that. 
 Weaponry and Military Deployment Operations , comment
9234 Hopefully that wraps up this Bakhmut filler arc but the producers have been stretching this one out as long as possible

In the interests of learning more, though, this appears to be a pretty typical old Soviet housing structure. Were they just using it as a base of operations? I ask mostly because, just from the short video, it mostly looks like an apartment complex blowing up

9313 I agree with the other comments along this line. The tank commander looks like he just wanted to show he understood the historical irony of driving in a German tank column through Ukrainian fields. The awkward, sort of naziesque salute just shows he is unfamiliar with typical panzerleader handsignals of that era. I think he was aiming for "Forward/vormarsch" I do not support Nazi stuff in any form in general, but this seems rather innocent, though poor optics of course.

9344 A very interesting video when freeze framed and looked closely at.  The first Russian shell managed to set off the powder charges about 30 m behind the gun in the trees and caused the large fireball, but the gun set up in the trail looked intact, though I am sure getting a little warm.  That is why they had to call in the second round that landed at the end of the video which landed ahead but actually a bit closer to the gun and possibly caused more damage than the first, even though it was a lot less impressive with no secondary explosions.  Neither round directly hit the gun and while I am sure that it was damaged, it is likely still repairable.

MIG31 have a short service life per airframe. They have been in service for a long time now so many are likely approaching the end of their service life.

What we see here is a technology piece that works with heat, easily distinguishing between warm and cold targets. While this isn't special, you can see that it has high frequency autonomous target identification that seems to be working very very well.  


I would not be surprised if this came in with a computer to do the calculations for the AGS-17 GL, that even calculates not just the distance and elevation difference, but relative target move speed and direction for a really precise targeting.

9448 I feel very sad that such a person is dead. It is good to read such a well composite letter reminding us all not to judge a people by its rulers. Russia has had a long tradition of elites behaving and abusing the system and the collapse of the Russian society in 1989 where the normal people‚Äôs savings just evaporated leading to the Rise of the oligarchs, a feudal network of collaborators to the system. 

My hope is that a new generation of Russians choose not to participate in oppressing their fellow citizens.

My hope is that this future is not too far away. It worked well in Eastern Germany where Stasi ruled for a long time. Hopefully in 30 years time we‚Äôll see a smaller and democratic Russia where the surprlus from oil and natural resources like in Norway pave the way for a better future.

That‚Äôs what happens when officials pocket most of the budget for buildings, roads and other infrastructure. Not saying this doesn‚Äôt happen in unoccupied Ukraine, but certainly not at the scale it happens in Russia and old Russian/Soviet areas that are still under that sphere of influence.

9511 Ruzzia is a fascist/nazi state
Ruzzia is a terrorist state
Ruzzia sponsors Global Crime
Ruzzia enables individual criminal activity.
Ruzzia profits from murder etc
Ruzzia has no standing on the World stage
Ruzzia is a thug nation
Ruzzia is the Charlie Zelenoff of nations. Not much more than aggressive.

Putin is not a Global leader
Putin holds no credibility in anything he says or claims. (He‚Äôs probably not even that good at judo).

Ôøº

The Economist on Russian Military Weakness During the Crimean War in 1854

I found this article from The Economist, a British based newspaper, critiquing the Russian military and government. It sounds eerily familiar.

A YEAR ago we ventured to hint that it might be worthwhile for Europe to go to war with Russia for the sake of information ‚Äî in order to ascertain that is whether her strength was that of the bully or the giant ‚Äî whether she was really entitled to dictate and domineer as she habitually did ‚Äî whether, in a word, she was mighty in virtue of her own inherent force, or only in virtue of the ignorant timidity of her foes and rivals. We pointed out several notable sources of weakness in her institutions; we directed attention to the fact that nearly all her great acquisitions had been secured not by fighting but by bullying and intriguing; that diplomacy and not war had always been her favourite weapon; that she kept up such an enormous army on paper that all secondary States had arrived at the conclusion that resistance to her will was hopeless, but that in general she bad carefully abstained from coming into actual armed collision with any first rate Power. We expressed an opinion, too, that there was no reason whatever to suppose that her armies were as effective now as in 1815, when they were supported by the subsidies of England and trained and disciplined by wars with France; and we ventured to surmise that when they came into actual conflict with competent forces and skilful commanders they would exhibit a degree of feebleness and failure that would cause general amazement. Our suspicions have now been more than realised. [‚Ä¶]

This unexpected weakness of Russia in military matters arises from four concurring causes, of which three are inherent in her system, and, if not absolutely incurable, are at least little likely to be cured.

In the first place, the nature of the country and the want of roads. Her resources may be vast but they are scattered and remote. Her forces may be immense, but they are necessarily in great measure distant from the scene of action. [‚Ä¶]

Secondly. The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the official purse, but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything necessary to the action of a soldier. The colonels of regiments and officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible ‚Äî inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the between these figures. They have an interest also in the men being as inadequately fed and clothed as possible ‚Äî inasmuch they pocket the difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended on the soldiers‚Äô rations and accoutrements. The Emperor provides (or believes he does) for the food, clothing, lodging, arms and ammunition of 5 or 600,000 men; but every one of these who is or can be made non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest official or officer; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the major; every ammunition wagon which is paid for by Government, but not provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor. Robbery and peculation of this sort is universal, in every rank, in every district, in every branch. It runs through every department in the Empire; and its operation upon the efficiency of the military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily exaggerated.

This horrible and fatal system originates in two sources, both, we fear, nearly hopeless, and certainly inherent in Russian autocracy: the rooted dishonesty of the national character, and the incurable inadequacy of despotic power. Cheating, bribery, peculation pervade the whole tribe of officials, and are, in fact, the key-note and characteristic of the entire administration. There seems to be no conscience, and not much concealment, about it. The officers are ill paid, and of course pay themselves. Regard for truth or integrity has no part in the Russian character. We have heard those who know them well say that there are only three honest men in the Empire:‚Äî Woronzow is one, Nesselrode another ‚Äî and men differ about the name of the third. We have heard Statesmen, who strongly incline towards a Muscovite alliance, say that the Russians are liars above all things: it is their sp√©cialit√©. Then the power of the Autocrat, absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised, is utterly insufficient to meet the evil. What can a despot do who has no instruments that can be trusted? There is no middle class who pay the taxes and insist upon knowing how they are expended. There is no free Press, with its penetrating and omniscient vigilance, to compel honesty and drag offenders to light and retribution. There is only one eye over all: and that eye can of course see only a small corner of this vast Empire. What the Emperor looks at, or can visit, is well done: everything else is neglected or abused. It is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralisation and barbarism combined.

Thirdly. The common soldiers, brave and hardy as they are, devoted to their Czar, and careless of privation, have no love for their profession, and no interest in the object of the war. If we except the household regiments, who are near the person of the Emperor, the Russian private has no zeal for glory, no taste for fighting, no pleasure in bold and exciting enterprises. He is serf, seized by the conscription, and condemned to hopeless slavery for life. He is torn from his family and his land, drilled by the knout*, neglected by his officers, fed on black bread, where fed at all, always without comforts, often without shoes. How can such troops be expected to make head,‚Äî we do not say against French enthusiasm, we do not say against British resolution, we do not say against fanatical and hardy mountaineers, like Shamyl** and his warriors, ‚Äî but even against courageous well fed Turks, fighting for their country and their faith, and officered by competent commanders? We need not wonder to read that at Oltenitza and Silistria the Russians had to be on to the assault with menaces and blows; that general had to sacrifice their lives in an unprecedented manner in order to encourage the soldiers to make head against the foe; and that the prisoners of war begged as a mercy to be permitted to enlist in the army that had captured them rather than return to misery by being exchanged.

Lastly. There is another source of weakness in the Russian Empire. That vast State is in a great measure composed of spoils which she has torn from surrounding nations. She is a patchwork of filched and unamalgamated materials. Her frontier provinces are filled with injured, discontented, hostile populations, whom, being unable to reconcile to her rule, she has endeavoured to enfeeble and to crush; and many of whom wait, with more or less of patience and desire, the blessed day of emancipation and revenge. ‚Ä¶ Since the great Roman Empire probably, no State ever enfolded so many bitter enmities within its embrace, or was girt with such a circle of domestic foes.

Now these three last sources of Russian weakness are perennial. They belong to her as a despotism as a centralised administration, as an Empire formed by conquest and unconsolidated and unsecured by conciliation. Until, therefore, her whole system changed; till an honest middle class has been created; till her Government be liberalised and de-centralised; till a free Press be permitted and encouraged to unveil and denounce abuses; and till the rights and feelings of annexed territories be habitually respected, we do not think that Russia need henceforth be considered as formidable for aggression. She has been unmasked; it will be the fault of Europe if it dreads her, or submits to be bullied by her, any longer.

Tajik migrant Foziljon Umarov recently applied to renew his expiring Russian residency permit in Nizhny Novgorod Province, where he works as a bricklayer.

As Umarov handed in his documents at the migration department, a clerk asked him if he would consider joining the Russian military.

"She said if I became a contract soldier I'd no longer need a residency permit or a work permit and could get a Russian passport after six months of military service. I would also earn about $3,000 a month," Umarov claimed.

He said the employee who spoke to him at the migration center was an ethnic Tajik.

"She spoke Tajik with me. I don't know if they hired a Tajik employee specifically to speak to Tajik migrants, and Uzbek clerks for Uzbeks, etc.," Umarov said.

Many migrant workers from Central Asia say Russian recruiters have increasingly approached them at mosques, in dormitories, and at migration offices to try to lure them into joining the military as Moscow struggles to replace its depleted forces in Ukraine.

Moscow has not officially announced a new military mobilization after its "partial" call-up of some 300,000 reservists in September caused tens of thousands of Russian men to abruptly flee the country.

The government plans to recruit 400,000 new soldiers to fight in Ukraine, according to Russian regional government sources.

Russian officials have expanded their campaign to attract potential contractors -- both Russian citizens and foreign workers -- with a promise of money and other benefits.

Recruiters on Russian city streets are handing out brochures to men claiming those who sign up for the military contract service will receive an initial one-time payment of $2,390, followed by salaries of up to $4,160 a month.

Photos and videos sent to RFE/RL show similar leaflets hanging on the walls, doors, and staircases in migrant workers' dormitories.

One video obtained by RFE/RL's Tajik Service purports to show a representative of a Russian military recruiting office giving a speech at a popular mosque in the city of Chelyabinsk.

"You don't have to wait five years to become Russian citizens -- instead you can sign a contract for military service for six months or up to one year in exchange for fast-track citizenship for yourself and your families," the uniformed man tells the congregation in the mosque.

Another video depicts a man in the Russian military outfit promoting contract military service to a group of men, some of whom can be heard speaking Uzbek. The video purportedly shows Central Asian migrants lining up for work permit in the western city of Penza.

Recruiters say those willing to become military contractors don't even have to take the mandatory medical checkup, says Jurabek Amonov, a migrant rights advocate in Russia.

"They only need to sign a paper saying 'I am healthy,'" Amonov told RFE/RL on April 10.

"I always tell the migrants that 99 percent of those who went to war in the hope of getting Russian passports were killed in Ukraine. It's also illegal for them to go to Ukraine," he said.

Not My War

Russia hosts millions of migrants from Central Asia and other former Soviet countries where unemployment has been a major problem the past three decades.

Most migrants have stayed away from the widely condemned war their host country has waged against Ukraine. But it is believed that many hundreds or thousands have accepted jobs in Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories -- mostly working for Russian construction companies.

Since the war began in February 2022, dozens of families in Central Asia have received the bodies of relatives killed in Ukraine. Some of them were naturalized Russian citizens, some were foreign contractors, and there were also convicts recruited from Russian prisons often under pressure.

Despite the falling value of the Russian ruble, a shrinking job market, and other consequences of the war, Russia remains a key destination for Central Asian workers.

One Tajik migrant contacted RFE/RL from a deportation detention center in the Far Eastern Russian city of Vladivostok earlier this month, saying a military recruitment officer had come to the facility to meet with the detainees.

"The officer told us, 'You are being deported and can't return to Russia for at least five years, but if you agree to join the Russian military your records will be wiped clean, you'll get a good wage, and become Russian citizens after just six months,'" said the Tajik man on condition of anonymity.

Though he said he wasn't convinced, some others "seriously considered accepting the offer, because going back to Tajikistan with no money, no jobs, and no future is almost as bad."

In Nizhny Novgorod, migrant worker Umarov decided to reject the offer of a Russian passport and $3,000 a month to fight in Ukraine, although he makes only half of that amount during the height of the summer work season.

"I am not going to Ukraine at any cost," Umarov said. "It is not my war."

9884 What‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs biggest accomplishment? He has succeeded in turning the Russian army (self-proclaimed second best army in the world) into‚Ä¶ the second best army in Ukraine. 

On realising Russia was losing the war Putin met Stalin in a dream and sought his advice: ‚ÄúStalin, how can I win the war?‚Äù Stalin gave him advice: ‚ÄúSend five million Russians to their death in Ukraine and paint the Kremlin blue.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy blue?‚Äù asked Putin. Stalin chuckled to himself ‚ÄúI knew you wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the first part.‚Äù 

Later Putin was overheard talking to a portrait of himself. Putin asked ‚ÄúWhen not if we lose the war what will happen?‚Äù The portrait replied ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll take me down and hang you instead!‚Äù No wonder Putin‚Äôs favourite song is Crimea river. 

‚Ä¶. and to think I thought Putin was a prim and proper President until I read the epic spy novel Beyond Enkription in The Burlington Files series by Bill Fairclough to finish off my MI6 induction program ... At least now I know why Putin spells Ukraine, Mykraine, how Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy learnt to spell his own name. For more beguiling anecdotes best read a brief and intriguing News Article about Pemberton‚Äôs People in MI6 dated 31 October 2022 in TheBurlingtonFiles website and then read Beyond Enkription.

But, if they are serviced and maintained as the rest of the russian military equipment russkis would nuke themselfes anyway! It costs a fortune to the us army to look after their collection and russia is not even able to have such a budget - so they will be useless in most cases.....

Everytime a russian "diplomat" is talking its just bluffing and lies and lies.....why do we even recognise them as diplomats after Lawrows statement at the 22nd of feb 2022 - "we have no intenions to invade....."

 Basically russia believes during wartime anything goes to ensure a win. They have done this through there recent history and believe after giving up on decency and righteousness they can recover and become a communist paradise.

They failed so many times it is craziness to think they could ever succeed. Yet they are too stubborn to accept their actions are what destroys them every time they enter a war.

Russia is all about war, nothing more, as soon as there leaders decide they want to distract the people from their sad lives they start a war, nothing more.

hes an ethically challenged sociopath larping as a crusader.  hes to integrity what varoufakis is to economics or what farage is to international relations:  a malignant narcissist who attracts simpletons with near zero underlying understanding, considered long view, or substantive ability to enter real dialog with grown ups.

9942 Hi everyone. Unpulpular as she was, she was very intelligent and this was one of her last public appearences before she got demented (you can alreadt tell that she is not as sharp as she used to be here)

But she was very right about the future, and here she talks about Putin just 1 year after he became President

edit: Sorry for mispelling her name in the headline

Edit: Summary: "She says: I have looked at pictures of Mr. Putin trying to look for a trace of humanity. I should have in a few weeks have know better...ect ect" 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
9943 According to Thatcher here she recognised Putin's character (or perhaps the old Russian/Soviet ways of doing things) when Putin failed to call in help for the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000. I note that this predates Bush's famous claim to have seen Putin's soul in 2001 (https://dailycaller.com/2010/12/14/bush-explains-his-comment-about-putins-soul-says-russian-leader-changed/) - from this link it looks as though Bush was convinced at that time that Putin was decent because Putin showed signs of Orthodox piety.

9950 Russians hung a school teacher in the street and just beheaded a Ukrainian POW, and it seems they've done this more than once. This is the sort of thing ISIS did and the world was revolted by it.

The Russian president suffered ‚Äòsevere pain‚Äô in his head, blurred vision and a ‚Äònumb tongue‚Äô according to General SVR Telegram channel.

He is also said to have experienced a ‚Äòpartial loss of sensation in his right arm and leg‚Äô requiring urgent medical attention.

A ‚Äòcouncil of doctors‚Äô performed first aid, and ordered Putin to take medication and rest for several days.

But rather than following this advice, the Russian premier refused to rest, choosing instead to give gloomy reports from the war in Ukraine.

His condition improved, easing concern among his large team of medics, said the post.

It stated: ‚ÄòThe president‚Äôs relatives were more worried.‚Äô

10123 The ROC, or Moscow Patriarchate, was revealed during Glasnost to be compromised by the Cheka (the various incarnations of the Russian covert services) to such extent it was said to be a ‚Äúsister company of the KGB‚Äù by Gleb Yakunin.

This compromise happened immediately following the October Revolution, but it should be said prior to this the Patriarchate and Cheka of Imperial times had shared a similar, if not identical relationship.

The ROC is considered to have been been an operational wing of Russian intelligence the entirety of its embroilment with the Russian state.

Note: There is a penchant among Western Protestant eschatologists (those who study The Apocalypse) to associate the Roman Catholic Church with The Beast, The Great Whore of Babylon, Antichrist, etc., but this came about through Reformation propaganda, and not Biblical literacy.

Geographically, the Eastern Christian churches were the original Christian colonies. Many of the first ‚Äúorganic‚Äù Christian churches took root in Anatolia, modern day Turkey (‚Äúorganic‚Äù meaning spread by the Apostles, inspired and guided by The Holy Spirit, not governmental diktat).

The Roman emperor who would make Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, Constantine The Great, also reunited the Empire divided into East/West by Diocletian in 286AD.

Constantine made the ancient city of Byzantium the de facto capital of this reunited Empire. Critically to this note, he called the city, ‚ÄúNew Rome.‚Äù While New Rome prospered immensely, Italian Rome fell prey to Germanic invaders, falling about a century later.

The remnant of the Empire was still referred to as Rome by its citizenry, but today we call it The Byzantine Empire. New Rome also underwent a name change, to Constantinople.

The mother church to Eastern Orthodox sects was situated in Constantinople. To this day, under the name given by Turkey in 1930, Istanbul, the site is holy to some derivative Orthodox sects. These sects, due to their roots in Greek Anatolia, can be referred to as ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù churches.

Now. All this long talk leads to one of those sects.

Today, the Russian Orthodox Church considers itself to be the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù inheritor of the Greek Orthodox tradition, and Russia itself considers itself the surviving remnant of Greek culture. While this is dubious at best, for the purpose of modern eschatology, we must accept that their assertion influences their decision making.

If we remove the anti-Catholic propaganda from Western popular eschatology, and instead compare the history of the Russian Orthodox Church to Biblical prophecies of the end times, a more clear picture of the hypocrisy, and the apostasy of Antichrist, etc, can be drawn.

It‚Äôs critical to remember Rome had basically fallen, was reunited by Constantine, and that the capital of the Empire‚Äôs rebirth was named New Rome.

Draw the line from then to today, with a murderous, global espionage unit working as a sister company to Russia‚Äôs Cheka, and contender for The Great Whore of Babylon, Antichrist, and The Beast isn‚Äôt so clear cut anymore.

Let the residents of St. Petersburg feel the fear of knowing they are not safe from bombs, either from Russian partisans, extreme right fascists or the Ukrainian umderground.

St. Petersburg is large enough that it likely has people from almost all over the former USSR, since the communists mixed the peoples in various cities and regions by moving them from one region to another.

"There is no need to force the disintegration of the Russian Federation, as it is a forced entity and they will fall apart on their own national independent entities. This worries our Western partners. It is easier when one holds everything - they think it is easier to negotiate. The only thing that interests the partners in this regard is how to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into different hands. But the evolution took place and it continues."

10194 What does the Pope have to do with this?

Last time I checked, both Russia and Ukraine follow Orthodox Christianity.  The Orthodox equivalent of the Catholic Pope would be the [Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople).  Except Russia [excommunicated the patriarchate in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Moscow%E2%80%93Constantinople_schism) for trying to make the Church of Estonia independent, and [again in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Moscow%E2%80%93Constantinople_schism) for doing the same to Ukraine.

The position of Putin seems clear:  The only legitimate Orthodox leaders are the ones Putin can control.

If Putin requires the *Orthodox* clergy to be subordinate to his government, how does he give a flying fig what the heretical [1] Catholics think?

[1] From an Orthodox point of view, Catholics are heretics (and vice versa).

Edit: some preliminary search says that the ROC is of course rotten to the core, I do not have much faith in this "secret" mission if it has to be undertaken with the ROC on hand.

10271 I was in Estonia a year before the invasion of Ukraine.  I met some Russian-Estonians who were the children or grandchildren of people who had emigrated from Russia during Soviet times.  They had learned Estonian and were either Estonian citizens or working to become citizens.  They considered Estonia their home and assumed their children would be Estonians.  They felt that Estonians did not welcome them there and did not trust them and that made things difficult for them.  The reason they were not trusted was that it was assumed that if Russia were to invade, they would use the excuse that they were doing it to protect ‚ÄúRussians‚Äù in Estonia. They explained that they loved Estonia but if any Russian-Estonian wanted to move to Russia they could but nobody would be that foolish.  If Russia were to invade, they would all fight for Estonia.

‚ÄúWe need to stop deceiving the population and telling them that everything is fine,‚Äù he said, 
accusing Russia‚Äôs top military brass of deluding themselves about the war or ‚Äúnot giving a damn.‚Äù

"What have we even done [since Feb. 24]? We‚Äôve turned the Russian army ‚Äì the second army in the world ‚Äì into what? Who the hell knows. ‚Ä¶ What kind of army are we if we couldn‚Äôt even manage with itty bitty Ukraine?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complete mess everywhere, there‚Äôs no discipline. The army has everything, but there is absolutely no control, while there is an absolute paranoid gap between that which is happening in the trenches, and that which they know and think about in headquarters.‚Äù

"In the nearly hour-and-a-half long video interview‚Äîapparently filmed days earlier‚Äîhe read out a letter he said he‚Äôd sent to Shoigu on Friday, in which he issued a brazen ultimatum threatening to pull his mercenaries out from Bakhmut if the defense ministry does not immediately provide the required ammunition.

10332 Prigozhin been trying to set himself apart from Putin's regime for a while. It's no secret that the Wagner group is dissatisfied with the support of the regular Russian army and he's certainly trying to shift the blame. He's also probably eyeing Putin's chair and trying to get support within Russia; dunno how that's going for him. He's playing a dangerous game though. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10333 I'd be very cautious believing anything coming from him or any infighting.

The reality is that there are good chances that Russia is following the same old soviet tactics. Nothing really changed and the "infighting" was used as a tool to make foreign countries believe in the USSR being "divided" but it would also be used inside Russia to find dissident.

In other words, infighting was meant to make some people come out of the shadow and support the false opposition. For example, anyone coming out to support Prigozhin would be flagged as a dissident and take care of. Prigozhin himself is allowed to look he's an opposition only to catch the real dissident.

10334 russia is a country that is founded on corruption, lies, exploitation and selfishness at its core. You don't get any power in russia by playing nice.

The problem with that is that everyone is an incompetent crook. So when shit hits the fan nobody can be relied on for anything and their whole society just eats itself.

It's inevitable and they deserve every second of the shit they have created for themselves.

I've got bad news for you. As bad as you guys are,... you were never the second army of the world. You just pretended to be. To your credit, the world believed you, but in any real war with a near-peer, Russia would have folded like a hot-pressed napkin. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10340 Interesting stuff if it turns out to be true. I have no reason to not believe it is, but I'm always skeptical about what anyone in a position of power in Russia says. I truly hope for a rapid collapse of the Russian army, although I could be dreaming too much. Why? It's not that I want the soldiers dead or more destruction, it's because only severe Russian losses will end this absurd war. True... that isn't good for Putin, but he also has to keep the peace at home. Right now... there is NOT peace at home and it appears to be getting worse. My proof? Pro Kremlin media personalities and those in the know losing their collective mind over how the war is going (even the skewed version they're getting).

10341 Prigozhin thinks it's all about him.  He's trying to shame the Russian army and politicians to give him more ammo.  The problem is there truly is no ammo to spare. Prigozhin is trying to publically deflect blame in anticipation of Wagner's upcoming defeat.  But I would argue it is Prigozhin's responsibility to procure ammo for his troops as a "private" military company.  

If Wagner has no ammo, then Prigozhin has outlived his usefulness.  Prigozhin is gone as soon as the FSB catches up to him for mouthing off like this.

10350 People need to stop taking this talk at face value. Russian leaders, military, political, or otherwise, lie by default. This is probably some kind of convoluted scheme to make people think he and Putin aren't on good terms. They probably cooked up this scheme recently because they are more interested in propaganda and misinformation than winning the war. They can't cook up a scheme to win, since their military is fundamentally broken, and their threats against the west backfired, so this is all they have left.

Seriously I doubt he would organize a mutiny I'd it happened, he's still being paid by Russia and his best interests are to remain in Russian hands. He cannot defect to Ukraine, the soldiers would shoot him on sight. He also can't run to Belarus or Poland because Poland hates him and Belarus is a Russian puppet. He could hitch a boat to Romania or turkey but Russia is willing to assassinate people thry see as threats, not saying he shouldn't do it anyway, it would rid the world of his presence.

Looks Ike he's trying to give himself an out: if the war goes badly and Wagner is defeated, then he can blame the Russian defense ministry leadership, with a statement already on public record of their incompetence and efforts to sabotage Wagner, and hence, the war itself. 

On the other hand, if Wagner gets what it needs and emerges with a victory (at least in Bakhmut), he will have 'hero' staus which he will use mercilessly to further his own political ambitions and destroy his enemies in the Kremlin.

10370 Putin‚Äôs really close to being overthrown - he as a leader not the governmental structure itself. 

Think about how Josef Stalin would handle this particular situation. This guy would‚Äôve been taken out back of the Lubyanka and executed before the words would‚Äôve come out of his mouth. Stalin was such a paranoid psychopath he had the entire military leadership executed or sent to a gulag, because he was nervous about losing power. 

There hasn‚Äôt been a Russian (autocratic) leader who had such little control of power in the last hundred years - and maybe longer than that. I don‚Äôt know much of that before 1900. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10371 This would be excellent if it at all were true. If Wagner leader did in fact criticize Putin, the MoD and Shoigu and it was broadcast to all of Russia including the Kremlin.. this guy would be falling out of windows for the rest of his very short life and someone else would take his place.

But it's not. It sounds great but I hardly doubt this guy puffed up his chest to Shoigu and Putin and then put them on blast saying they were losing the war and wer√© a laughing.stock.

While his assessment is true, what they say he's doing isn't what is happening. He'd be signing his death warrant. 

I do wish it would happen as it would be seeding more discord and disruption in Russia and showing exactly how we all wish things are working and going over there. But everyone is so scared for their own future and life I don't think we are there yet and I think everyone is a yes man still and reporting things are ok,  ut could be better.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a coup plan is in place. Putin looks inept and anemic while Wagner is actually fighting.

Sunday's election in Russia said he occasionally gets beer sent to him   
from German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.

"Angela sends me some bottles of Radeberger beer from time to time,"says the Kremlin chief in the film. Putin was previously stationed inDresden as an agent of the Soviet secret service KGB"

I think the Germans realize this and are kinda freaked out. Putin literally went full dictator in an information bubble with the Ukraine invasion. He ended Europe‚Äôs Long Peace that had lasted since WW2. Putin being willing to completely ruin Russia‚Äôs economy and crush any and all dissent is scaring a lot of European politicians.

10401 Prigozhin is running a Psyop

I see people constantly commenting and listening to what he says as if he is a high ranking Russian military commander or expert. His a hitman

His PMC, while some what well equipped and supplied. Is mainly used as a blunt instrument of violence. Not only in Ukraine but around the world. In particular in Africa where they have committed "the raping of Nanjing" atrocities 

He wants to become the "McDonald's of War". A PMC that is as recognised and known as the "brand of war". Which he gets by becoming infamous 

Almost everything he says is bullshit. He is playing it up for you ( yes us westerners) and Russian clients. Because he is getting paid! 

Once again he is a hitman. A hoe for blood 


The actual Russian army is starting to move into Bakmut. In particular an Airborne division ( think same that was involved in Kiev 2022). Wagner were used as canon fodder for months. Willing too! As most were convicted criminals sent in death waves

10458 They will let Medvedev out for a bit and he will threaten to nuke Poland. Then its again his naptime so he will get a bit vodka for being a good boy. Maybe they will also do a little circlejerk over it in one of their daily propaganda shows, fail to consult the map and threaten to sink Poland with one of their mythical Poseidon torpedoes. 

And then they fret a little more over Ukraine coming counteroffensive, try real hard dream a world where it would not come but fail to do so and then they sob a little more.

Time proves, they really don't give a f. 

I studies for two years in St-Petersburg, I speak Russian natively, and I root for Ukraine with every fiber of my soul, but I'll be damned if they still don't have an uphill battle to fight.

10570 Isn't this Step 3 in Russia's playbook of nuclear weapons deployment?

Step 3 is a nuclear weapons test, which shows the ability of their nuclear weapons (this) and that they aren't just on paper. Step 4 is the actual deployment of a nuclear weapon. Step 5 is hope Step 3 fails and is 100% consistent.

"This building belongs to the Warsaw City Hall," Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina told AFP, adding that the move followed a bailiff's order. "This is an illegal act. An intrusion on a diplomatic facility," Moscow's envoy, Sergei Andreyev, told the RIA Novosti news agency.

10594 Guess what Russians took with them when leaving the building? ...those people are from a different galaxy, really.

10595 I am polish and this article gets a couple things wrong. The "spy nest" building from 1970 is not the school (which is pictured and mentioned in the title). The spy nest (polish: "Szpiegowo") can be seen in pictures here:

The school building visible in the picture is not the "spy nest". The building of the school was "given" russia in 1945 by a puppet government they set up in poland themselves. That's how they got it.

> Internationally recognized Bulgarian-Canadian animator and film director Theodore Ushev has declined an award from the Moscow Film Festival to protest Russia&#039;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in an address that was banned by the Kremlin&#039;s censors.

> The Moscow event has been among the world&#039;s most prestigious international film festivals since its founding in 1935, but its accreditation was suspended more than a year ago by the International Federation of Film Producers amid global outrage over Russia&#039;s large-scale invasion of Ukraine.

> Russian television broadcast the ceremony with the announcement of the award for Phi 1.618 but ignored Ushev&#039;s outspoken criticism of a war that Russian censors call a &quot;Special military operation."

> Antennas and satellite dishes placed on roofs of buildings at the Russian embassy in Helsinki could be tools of espionage, according to the Finnish News Agency STT. Vsquare, an international investigative journalism network, reported that similar equipment placed on Russian embassies across Europe has been used to conceal intelligence gathering methods.

> STT photographed at least 11 satellite dishes and antennas on the roofs of buildings in the embassy campus in Helsinki.

> According to the former intelligence officers interviewed by Vsquare, sheds on the embassy campuses are also likely to contain signal intelligence equipment that can be used to monitor, radio and cellphone communications.

"Kremlin emphasizes possibility of Russia conducting a nuclear weapons test. The Kremlin on Friday highlighted the prospect that Russia could be preparing to carry out a nuclear weapons test, asserting that not all nuclear states are abiding by a moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons.

This came in response to an interview given by Lynne Tracy, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, who told the Kommersant newspaper that Russia was the only country discussing the possible discontinuation of nuclear testing."

I'd say this is Putin setting up to remove him, he can't have a threat to the throne.the Warner mercenaries will either be amalgamated into the regular army or the best outcome is Warner saying fuck it and disbanding and those troops all leaving. Realisitxally though theyre 100s of miles away, many convicts not due release and theyll be stuck there forever.

10685 The Russians have never been known for their abilities with logistics.  


The multiplicity of their command arrangements, that is regular army, mercenary units, and local units from the Donetsk basin, must really make their logistic and supply arrangements, even more difficult.  


I'm not familiar with the structure of the Wagner group, but I imagine it to be long on teeth and short on tail.  So, when there are shortages of anything...and in a war, there's always are going to be shortages, then you have a dispute over who gets what.

10686 Russia pledges harsh response after Polish 'seizure' of embassy school in Warsaw 
 Russia: Internal Politics , post
10687 In 1986 Poland concluded an international agreement with the USSR on diplomatic real estate. Pursuant to the agreement, she handed over a dozen or so real estates in Warsaw and Gda≈Ñsk to the needs of the USSR diplomatic missions, in exchange for which she was to receive real estate in Moscow. Russia has never fulfilled its part of the agreement, for over 30 years it has illegally occupied plots of land for which it does not pay rent, although it conducts non-diplomatic activities there, such as renting commercial premises in the occupied buildings. The Russian side did not want to regulate this issue, despite the fact that the Polish government tried to negotiate with the Russia many times over the years. In the case of many properties occupied by Russia, final court judgments have been issued ordering the return of properties to the Polish side. Despite this, the Polish government withheld the bailiff's execution so as not to irritate diplomatic relations with Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed this situation and now real estate illegally occupied by Russia and not used as intended for diplomatic and consular activities are being seized.

10701 **\[Silicon Curtain\] Keir Giles - Russia's Hostile Intent - Why does Russia Behave like this? What does it achieve?**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHLrH9Q\_E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHLrH9Q_E4)

The algorithm saw fit to recommend me this channel and now I'm recommending it to you all. Every few days, the host (Jonathan Fink) speaks with a guest in a podcast-style hour-long interview. This one is especially interesting; it was hard to select just a few quotes so I selected a whole bunch of 'em:

>\[3:50\] Why exactly does Russia think that it is both *entitled* to do this and has a *duty* to do this? In fact, it is operating in an entirely different environment, mentally, from what we take for granted as normal and natural in the West. It is simply because Russia hasn't gone through the kind of national or societal transformations that other countries have. If you think of Russia's behavior at the moment \[...\] it's perfectly normal if you go back several centuries. In a way, the Russian threat is not just external to Europe but also it's external to the time we're in.  
>  
>\[6:15\] The whole issue of trying to ascribe Russian behaviors to some kind of theory of international relations is pretty damaging to understanding what it is that Russia thinks about the world and how it might react to the world around it.  
>  
>\[8:00\] One of the things that we've benefitted from greatly during this most recent crisis is President Putin and those around him have been entirely more honest about what it is that they want from the world and how they want to go about getting it. That has, for example, completely torpedoed all of the arguments that we heard over decades that Russia is just responding to NATO enlarging and NATO accepting membership applications from those countries that wanted protection from Russia. That pretense has been completely discarded by Russia.  
>  
>\[11:23\] The countries that think they are protected by distance from the Russian threat count the cost without understanding the risk of not investing those costs. The countries that would prefer Ukraine to sign a ceasefire agreement as rapidly as possible without realizing -- or possibly realizing but not caring -- \[...\] that that just rewards Russia for armed aggression, and confirms to Moscow that that is the best way to get what it wants.  
>  
>\[12:42\] I think people fail to understand how the imperial process works and has worked since Muscovy really came to the fore several hundred years ago: once it conquers a territory and it's able to subjugate that population then it will use that population to attack the next chunk of land. So by rewarding it Donbass, what you get is the weaponization of that population. As we've seen, forcing them into the meat grinder to fight essentially against their fellow Ukrainians. \[...\] Some will go willingly because of this brainwashing process.  
>  
>\[14:42\] Too many people got used to the idea of the Russia as they saw it during the 1990s and early 2000s. Weak, incapable, but also friendly towards the West and interested in International Relations. \[...\] That was the temporary interruption to the normal state of affairs, and now Russia is moving back towards its historical comfort zone: repression at home, and hostility abroad.  
>  
>\[18:47\] You have people leaving Russia in two waves primarily: first of all after Feb 2022 the people who did recognize what Russia had become and wanted nothing to do with it. \[...\] And then in Sep 2022 you had people who were ambivalent about the war -- possibly even in favor of it -- but didn't want to be involved with it personally. \[...\] It is a great deal more complex than assuming that because someone is outside Russia, they will not be still mentally within Russia. \[...\] What it also means is that those that are left behind, within Russia itself, on average are likely to be even more supportive of this war of colonial reconquest.  
>  
>\[23:17\] \[Author Jade McGlynn\] looks at the pattern of support, why they came about, why it is that Russians exist in this alternative reality with tragic consequences. Having been so isolated from real information about the outside world that at the beginning of the invasion, when Ukrainians called their friends an family members in Russia to explain what is happening... they're not believed, because it cannot possibly be that they are being bombed by Russians.  
>  
>\[28:40\] Russia's campaign for global influence over the last few years has been most successful where there has been a vacuum to move into. It can be a vacuum of Western interest, a vacuum of engagement by the former colonial powers, a vacuum of rule of law -- if you look at the patterns of Russian engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, they are most successful where there are fewest remaining safeguards against corruption and subversion of government. By contrast, where rule of law remains relatively strong, Russia doesn't make inroads. The consistent pattern is this: lack of resistance invites Russian intervention.  
>  
>\[31:49\] The general tone of Western diplomacy is completely unsuited to dealing with Russia. \[...\] Every country around Europe has its own particular problem in dealing with Moscow, and they are self-inflicted problems. \[...\] That's France under Macron with his messianic vision for striking out on his own to make France relevant. It's Germany under Scholtz with his absolute reluctance to actually do anything. It's the UK under a succession of prime ministers who did not want to look at the problem of Russian influence here because it would be deeply inconvenient for their party funding.  
>  
>\[33:29\] In the latter stages, when it was becoming completely clear that Putin was going to launch the invasion, these leaders, these senior figures, these diplomats, these espionage chiefs, were going to Moscow armed with that knowledge, confronting Russia saying we know that you are going to invade... but then not promising any consequences. Russia heard the same old words they'd heard so many times before and knew from past experience that this was something they needn't take seriously.  
>  
>\[37:40\] The experience of the 1990s has been twisted around 180 degrees so that rather than the West helping Russia -- which it did, pouring in billions of financial aid, delivering food when Russia was incapable of feeding its own population, trying to draw Russia into the international community \[...\] giving Russia the seat at the U.N. Security Council that it was entirely unentitled to, with devastating consequences now -- all of these are now being presented as ways in which the West "humiliated" Russia.  
>  
>\[47:38\] The approved history is very different from what actually happened, because Russia has returned to and reinforced all of the Soviet myths about the Second World War according to which it started in 1941 with an unprovoked assault by Nazi Germany and Russia was doing absolutely nothing before then... but also Russia's behavior during and after the war has been twisted beyond all recognition: the idea that this was a crusade of liberation of Eastern Europe as opposed to Russia following through on its plan of taking control of Eastern Europe in competition with Nazi Germany instead of in collaboration with it. The way in which the war started is elided from Russian history and it is a criminal offense to refer to it; you can get prosecuted for pointing out the real events of 1939-1940.  
>  
>\[52:28\] These ideas of starting a new relationship are based on the mental image of Germany or Japan after the Second World War without going through that vital stage of a decades-long process of uprooting the constitution, the education system, changing social attitudes and so on. Whatever happens in Russia has to happen organically, which means it is going to take vastly longer... but the key ingredient is going to be defeat in Ukraine, because without a setback to Russian imperial aims that is sufficiently resounding \[...\] there will not be that initial seed that might initially lead to change. And therefore we are going to be facing the same Russia problem into the foreseeable future. That is the reason why so many of these calls for a negotiated settlement -- for freezing the conflict instead of resolving it -- are unfortunately fraught with disaster.  
>  
>\[54:54\] My fear is that the opportunity to deal that defeat to Russia may have been missed through Western countries subscribing to this idea that you cannot defeat Russia because it's too dangerous. On the other hand, Ukraine will continue to be the frontline, will continue to be the defenders of Europe -- but potentially not the only one. If Russia finds that there is a softer target elsewhere along its Western periphery, it will go for that softer target as it always has done.

10703 >Oil tank farm still burning

Imagine those Russian farmers getting up at the crack of dawn to slide into their overalls and, rain or shine, work this land every morning since the  illegal occupation of Crimea nearly a decade ago.  Having seen with their own eyes that herd of young feisty barrels slowly mature into the stout fuel storage tanks we see today. Tanks that at one time may have been bursting at the seams with the finest vintages of everything from light-medium sweet Novy Port, Varandey, and your heavy sour Arco grades. Only to have that all taken away from them in an instant, being reduced to a dense plume of toxic smoke just hanging over the region at the start of tourist season like a guilty conscience. Truly heartbreaking.

10710 Russia is on the brink of catastrophe." Prigozhin issued an ultimatum to Shoigu and threatened Putin with military mutiny

Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the PMC "Wagner", wrote a letter to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, demanding to provide ammunition. Prigozhin gave an ultimatum that if the problem with supplies for his PMC is not solved, he will complain to Putin, and the mercenaries will leave their positions in Bakhmut and retreat.
 
"I appeal to Shoigu with a request to immediately issue ammunition. In case of refusal, I consider it necessary to inform the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Putin) about the existing problem in order to make a decision and about the advisability of further presence of the "Wagner" PMC in Bakhmut in conditions of ammunition shortage. The deadline for making a decision is today, April 28," Prigozhin said.

The leader of the mercenaries said that "ammunition is no longer left for weeks, but for days." "If the shortage does not stop, part of the units we will be forced to withdraw from this territory, and then everything else will collapse," Prigozhin said.

10711 There are some very significant rumours coming out of the Bakmut sphere.

In particular, Putin has given a May 8th deadline for its capture, with severe repercussions for all his underlings if it doesn‚Äôt happen.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10712 This is a very interesting set of events occurring 

I have no doubt that Putler will want a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù!in Bakhmut by 9th of may, for the victory day parade 

With the video of Prigozhin coming out threatening to withdraw Wagner from Bakhmut if they don‚Äôt receive ammunition would be a catastrophe for them.

Either smoke and mirrors as is many things, or against all odds we‚Äôll start seeing Wagner retreat if Prigozhin was actually 100% serious.

From my totally armchair expert position, it seems to me Prigozhin only cares about money and power and has little to no care about Russian MoD or anything going on inside there. And given Wagner has mostly been the ones fighting in Bakhmut he is probably standing in a position of power to a degree. If he was to stand on his words and pull back Wagner from Bakhmut it would be an utter cluster fuck inside Russia

10716 This isn't a problem. This is a win-win. Russia is selling it to India at prices pretty much cents more than the sanctioned price. However, this also severely hurts Russia as the refinement process is extremely profitable. As India continues to do more, it also means further refinement capabilities which means even post sanctions, India is still going to be exporting it meaning that Russia likely lost a good portion of that revenue stream.

The question is, how long will the Russian military (what's left of it) stand for it?

If all of this, the war, deaths.. will not motivate the Russian military to say "we have had enough, time for change" I'm not sure anything  will..

10831 And STILL there are idiots outside Russia that support the regime. It doesn't matter if this regime kills, jails, tortures, invades, rapes.....all good to the trolls who admire Putin and his criminal regime.

10833 Imagine being Russian and knowing that the counteroffensive is getting closer and closer. And that the offensive will be huge and backed with quasi-modern Western weapons. 

Just that mental impact makes it worthwhile to keep talking about this. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10834 Smartest plan is to drop about 200,000 bottles of vodka along and behind Russian lines day before offensive with a note that says "Bringing the party to you!" Cost....$2M, outcome...priceless and probably over in a day. Have to send at least one load by catapult as a nod to Monty Python...plastic bottles of course with a label that says..."Just like you, recycleable." Further notation informs them that from that from that day on they will be commemorated yearly with national organic fertilizer day. Not being macabre, psychological warfare is a real thing

10840 In the big picture it's a good thing this war happened now before scientific and technological advancement puts war at a new level. If russia had waited 5-10 years, they might have been able to amass the technology and weapons to take over the world. Technological progress closes the gap between nations, before sanctions they more easily could have taken technology secrets and built up their power.

10918 First of all, thanks for your hard work. I have two questions.

1. I have heard of companies who resumed doing business in Russia after supposedly ceasing operation in Russia for a period of time, or at least claimed to be. Do you have a list of such companies and insight into why they made this choice?

2. What do you think of the sanctions so far in terms of the frequency/efficacy of imposing new sanctions, as well as their execution? 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10919 What have you generally found to happen after a company closes up shop in Russia?  Does the Russian government attempt to fill the vacuum with a state sponsored business where possible?  I assume the typical Russian on the street sees a difference in products/quality/availability.

10922 I work in asset management and we regularly speak with our investee companies about any exposure they have to Russia.

Typically, the responses are one of the following:

1) We have operations there and we have to keep operating (at reduced volumes) because otherwise the government will nationalise the assets under the guise it is intentional bankruptcy 

2) Our products are being sold there without our permission because of parallel import laws that we can‚Äôt do anything about 

3) It is impossible to find a buyer of our assets that isn‚Äôt sanctioned and meets our KYC laws

What do you make of these responses? 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10923 Is there a list of companies that haven't left Russia! 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10925 Professor Sonnenfeld, thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to answer our questions and thank you for your tireless work providing resources to engage the public in critical discussions around how to limit consumer spending towards companies which directly or indirectly support the war. 

A few questions, please answer any you have time for:

1.	What sanctions busting measures has Russia engaged in which you believe are the most effective? 
2.	Some of the academic literature refers to ‚Äúblack knight‚Äù states (ie. third party states which help sanctioned states access international markets). What effect have states like Turkey, India, China, CSTO members etc. had in mitigating the efficacy of sanctions on Russia? 
3.	Finally, [we have seen large cryptocurrency exchanges reenter the Russian market](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/24/crypto-exchange-binance-is-back-in-russia-lifts-restrictions-on-russian-users-report/). Although liquidity in the crypto market is obviously limited on the scale of nation states, what role have cryptocurrencies played in sanctions evasion and how concerned should policy makers be about the use of cryptocurrencies by sanctioned states moving forward?

10934 Russia has a very healthy debt to GDP ratio, at around 13% (compare that to USA's 123%). Does that mean that they could, in principle, have big public deficits for years in order to finance the war effort and perhaps even an economic recovery?

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10936 So much of the discussion of the Russian economy is based on the next couple years but from my understanding big economic events often take many years to fully unfold. Where do you see the Russian economy going in the late 2020s and early 2030s assuming the Kremlin doesn‚Äôt radically change course soon? 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10937 Really love all of you interviews, you have a very interesting inside of the actual situation.

I have seen that the last embargo on crude oil and refined oil products has been very effective, for example that Russia budget deficit has hit the full year target in the first two and half months of 2023, and since Russia is not able to prop up the Ruble again, even the Ruble is Sinking.

But I don't understand the apparent resilience of they stock market which apparently has been recovering or some people may say adapting to the sanctions, are those numbers real or are those probably some half made up numbers? How come Russian stock market is not doing that badly? It is possible a collapse of Russian banking system? Do you know if any new embargoes of Raw materials are coming from the EU and the west?

10941 "with our team estimating that 1,000 global corporations with in-country revenues representing close to 40% of Russia's GDP ceased operations there." 

This is a fairly useless statistic without additional information. I'm assuming the companies were either rebranded or replaced by another equivalent company. Russia's GDP hasn't dropped by 40%. I imagine it's somewhere between 0-40%. If it's 30%...okay big hit. if it's 5%...the Russian government probably doesn't care.

If anything I'd say you're misrepresenting the facts? 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10942 Most economic indicators like you already mentioned such as the automotive sector, consumption, real wages and others, are showing that Russia is in deep decline, then what can result from the official Russian statistics? Are they a blatant lie? or due to gas and oil prices Russia made large amount of money last year? also sanctions are working but they haven‚Äôt destroyed the russian service sector fully, so economically it may not make a large difference wether Russians eat in McDonalds or the replacement brand. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
10943 Thank you for your work and also for the AMA.

You say companies are leaving Russia and that it is having an impact on the economy; however aren‚Äôt there ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù nations to Russia, currently not under sanctions, which could simply act as a middle-man for goods and services?

I have continued to see videos of Russian stores stocked with internationally recognized (even American) brands and produce, and electronics stores in Russia still contain goods that are supposedly ‚Äúoff-limits‚Äù.

10949 Genuine question, why would Russia do this? When the pipeline was *turned off* they had leverage (because they could promise to turn it back on if people did what they wanted), but blowing it up just means they lose all that leverage? What's the play exactly?

It still seems more likely to me that somebody wanted to remove Russia's bargaining chip, while also unifying the West's resolve (can't negotiate about gas anymore so forced to take a harder line).

What am I missing?

10973 Fuck Russia and the bullshit war they‚Äôve started, but I don‚Äôt think it makes any sense they would‚Äôve blown up their own pipeline. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to do something like that when they can just shut it down on their end easily if they wanted to.

10974 So the average take is that Russia blew up NS1 because they were afraid of getting sued? ü§î So, what if they get sued, who's going to collect cash from them? The only way they would be able to pay is that if they exchanged their gas for the equivalent cash penalties. Afraid of being sued, but willing to go to war? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

10975 So it was a self-sanction after all. 

Russia sure played themselves showing Europe it could cut off Russian gas and not freeze to death.

10977 "His departure was reported by a Russian military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and by the RBC news site. Neither offered an explanation for why he had apparently been removed.

The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the Kremlin has said it cannot say anything on the subject and has referred questions on the matter to the defence ministry."

10995 I went on vacation to an all inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic over 10 years ago. Lovely place and people. There were a lot of Russians there, so many that there were a couple of billboards here and there in Russian/Cyrillic. Was a fun experience though I did notice some Russians drunk in the middle of the day starting a fight with some other guests. 

I have a friend who traveled years ago to another country for vacation, said a drunk Russian tried to start a fight with him at the swimming pool bar. 

Wait, there‚Äôs more. My wife‚Äôs younger cousin coincidentally went to the same part of the Dominican Republic that I visited and when he came back he unprompted mentioned that he felt like the Russians there were drunk and liked to start fights with people. 

My wife is from Colombia and so is her family. My friend is a non White American. I‚Äôm a white American dude. So if multiple people from very different experiences and different countries are all saying the same thing about you, wouldn‚Äôt you self reflect on whether or not you are the problem?

America hasn't gone all in on an enemy in quite some time and you really do not want to be on the receiving end of Warthogs and Raptors and F-35s and B1 bombers and Predator drones and all the other nastiness in the American arsenal.

11111 They‚Äôve been mapping the entire north sea infrastructure at the bottom of the sea. They‚Äôre looking how to sabotage the grid if they ever decide to attack, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they‚Äôre also using tech to tap communications. 

Here in the Netherlands our marine knows they‚Äôre out there and following their movement closely. Russian ‚Äúfishing‚Äù boats that stop for hours at very important keypoints of the grid. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. 

I wish something could be done about these Russians, they‚Äôre no good. I truly hope Ukraine can beat them and the people inside Russia will finally dethrone this Putin maniac.

11113 Russia has a handful of very capable newer submarines. Specifically their Borei SSBN, and Yasen SSGN. They are far and away better than anything China can field, and are a pain in the ass to track.

Over time they will suffer from maintenance neglect, but for their limited numbers now they are top of the line. 

I would say those are the two most formidable weapons that Russia has in their whole inventory. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11114 Good. The more the Russians run their equipment, the more the chance they‚Äôll wear out their operational hours and subject themselves to Russian ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù. The destruction of the Soviet stockpiles either directly or through wear, will shrink Russia‚Äôs capabilities.

The first official leadership meeting was held on Tuesday, during which Borissov made it clear that he was ready to fulfil the PP-DB‚Äôs wish and support a cabinet with a second mandate but asked to see its draft composition and evaluate it. 

Borissov said this should be done before his party gets the first mandate to decide whether to return it and go for a government with the second mandate ‚Äì of the PP-DB. President Rumen Radev has not yet scheduled the giving of the first mandate.

11173 Moscow Arbitration Court has ordered Finland's state-owned rail operator VR and the Finnish-Russian fleet company Karelian Trains to continue fulfilling their contractual obligations, including reinstating the Allegro train route between Helsinki and St. Petersburg.  
The court also ruled that VR's decision to unilaterally suspend passenger and freight services to Russia was illegal. VR made the decision in March 2022, shortly after the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, due to sanctions against Russia. In its ruling, the court ordered VR to pay the Russian railway company R≈ΩD approximately 10.1 million roubles, or around 112,000 euros.  
In addition, the ruling fined VR and Karelian Trains a further 1.3 million roubles, or roughly 14,000 euros, for each day after the court decision that the order is not complied with.  
"We have no comment on the matter because the Moscow court has no jurisdiction over the agreements between the parties," VR's communications department told Yle.  
The Allegro trains are owned by Karelian Trains, a company set up in 2006 and jointly owned by VR and the Russian railway firm R≈ΩD, which itself is state-owned.

> He said that he fought on the side of the Wagner mercenary group in Bakhmut in the east of Ukraine, but fled Russia because he was afraid for his life because of the Wagner Group&#039;s cruelty towards fighters from their own PMC.

11389 Checking the raw data, the polled countries constitute 72% of the world population, and that comes to 39.5% of the world population showing disapproval of Russian leadership. That isn't a "majority of the world".

How to extrapolate this? Assuming that a 57% disapproval rate (average of disapproval rate for the polled countries) for the remaining 28% of the world population, that comes to 55.5% of the world population that shows disapproval of Russian leadership. But that's assuming China, Russia, most part of Africa, and other not-polled countries shares a 57% disapproval rate, which is highly doubtful. So yeah, questionable headlines.

11392 Well deserved. Russia understands nothing but strength and economic disaster. Nothing else to discuss with them until they fuck off from Ukraine. Even after they fuck off, keep them isolated until they change; which is unlikely. Modern day barbarians.

11398 I'm old. Gen X, grew up in the last big hurrah of the cold war, saw the wall fall, saw Russia start again after the CCCP. I guess the old bias I grew up with never really left me, because even though I was happy for the Gorbachev/Yeltsin years... haven't we always assumed or knew that Putin was a full-on dictator. And like, not the good kind?

What still confuses me is all of the Americans who are seemingly...pro-Putin or pro-Russia? Like, how are the people who were raised in a cold war paranoia of Russia not more weary of them? And it seems to be mainly on the Republican/Conservative side? I thought this was the group of commie-haters that gave us McCarthy?

11404 I just want to give some insight on the Russian propaganda machine. To give some context: I have a son with a disability and, back in 2019, I once needed some stock footage related to disability and legislation for a web page. When I went to Google images and searched "Downs Syndrome and government" I was surprised to see that the first images to pop up were Putin meeting with individuals with Downs Syndrome. These images were at the forefront and given search engine priority despite the thousands of photographed and documented instances in which disability advocates with Downs Syndrome have met with presidents, governors and legislators all over the US. Even then, prior to the invasion of Ukraine, was I weirded out and felt like there was some algorithm that was being exploited to favor Putin.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11409 Some of this is that Russia ran a very successful propaganda campaign, influencing a lot of Westerners to thinking he was doing things they liked, some of this is People's outright support of his oppressive tactics as long as it was towards minorities they also disliked, such as LGBT people, and some of this may have been India and China looting a lot of cheap resources from Russia and the leaders of those countries telling the people that they liked Russia and demonizing the US.

11414 Russia suffering worst labor shortage in 25 years 
 Russia: Internal Politics , post
11415 Let's look at some factors here:

Military draw up takes workers off the job

Threat of conscription causes some workers to hide

Trade restrictions cause Russia to increase domestic production

War machine requires increased domestic production(exasperated by trade restrictions)

Lack of window safety causes workers to fall through them 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11416 There is no solution for this either. Russia's population was in decline before the war. No one immigrates to Russia. Now they are sending young men to die by the hundreds of thousands. The stage is being set for the fall of Russia. üòä 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11417 Ha Ha, there's no labor shortage in Russia, Putin, in his infallible wisdom, redeployed labor either to Ukraine or outside of the Russia (to avoid mobilization).

It is just a matter of priorities, Putin's priorities of sending bodies into the meat grinder over labor for manufacturing, industrial enterprises, water supply, mining and transportation and storage.

11422 I am very interested to see what happens when Russia runs out of foreign currency reserves and has to cut pensions and devalue the currency. 

Russia will implode when that happens. Old people will be upset with Moscow. Remaining young people will riot it leave the country for jobs. There will be too small of a workforce remaining to support pensions. 

It will be a nightmare, but a completely self inflicted one.

11426 Russia lost something like 80% of the male population born in the 1920s, so every 20ish years, there‚Äôs going to be a labor shortage- the ghost of generations of laborers that were never born. Add to that a functionally kleptocratic modern government and a land war, and you will quickly run out of workers.

> While imprisoned, Navalny has spent months in a tiny one-person cell, also called a &quot;Punishment cell,&quot; for purported disciplinary violations such as an alleged failure to properly button his prison robe, properly introduce himself to a guard or to wash his face at a specified time.

11524 Cause and Effect. 

Cause: Russia keeps threatening the security of EU countries.

Effect: EU countries need to invest in military defence to deter Russia from carrying out their threats.

You just do a teeny-tiny bit of genocidal invasion, you tell people to stay out of it with a nuclear strike threat or two... or ten... or a few hundred... you draw up plans for a Greater Russia, which includes sovereign nations - nothing for them to worry about, your ally shows these plans to the world when doing a debrief, your national television station declares that the UK is fair game for a nuclear strike which could be done at any time... and then the majority of the world turns against you *for no reason at all*..."

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11558 It's sad to see how the old Finnish sayings about how you'll end up if you do business with Russia are coming true. 

I don't see the relationship to our eastern neighbour ever improving during my lifetime. Russia is too far gone on so many levels it's easier to just assume the worst from them and you'll be fine. 

During USSR being a thing, really no one in Finland believed any word that came from that side of the border (except the part of population that believe any well told lie). We were taught from very early age, how listening to what USSR has to say about Finland will only make us mad and confused because they can't stop lying. When USSR was talked about by old people it was clear that nothing good came from that side of the border, ever.

At the same time Finland build part of its economy to sell shit quality products to USSR and when the Sovient Union fell, we had a recession for many reasons, but one was that we thought we could sell b-level consumer goods to USSR for forever. 


Of course on reddit's pop-politics and news Finland is this smart and calm party that knows Russia well, because that's an easy reality for stupid people. The reality of Finland not being unified even during later part of Winter War is a hard to digest on a national level, Continuation War was very unpopular here and there was really no strong unity in Finland despite decades of propaganda saying so.
 
And we are still divided and stupid. We almost let ROSATOM to make a nuclear power plant for us and I have no idea how many envelopes when into pockets to make that deal happen (Finland doesn't have corruption BTW, just the Finnish way to do corruption and we don't count that as corruption). Thankfully we backed out of that deal, but it needed a fucking war to wake us up, which is shameful.

Our naive thoughts about the world repeat in our politics and how we talk about them: The racist bigot party that loves dictators and authoritarian rule, the Finns Party, is going to be a cabined party soon and they were aligned with Putins rhetoric before the war, repeating his propaganda in Finland and downplaying the invasion of Crimea. Now it's all forgotten so that no one in media questions the why The Finns Party  (who wanted to ban abortions and roll back legislation on same sex marrage, hire more police and take money out of social programs while pushing culture war into schools and public places. Sound farmiliar???) allegendly took notes and help from Russian intelligence and trollfarms unknowingly or knowingly. No one in our private media (mostly all right-wing) never talk about how our rich righ-wing polticians and wannabe-oligarcs have licked the ass of Putin's inner circle for over a decade. 

Actually our media lets these wannabe-oligarcs clean their background constantly and even helping their family members into politics while saying how we should be mindful that LEFT WING in the 60's was kinda in bed with USSR. It's a joke how little Finland cares about Russian influence in its politics because Russia is a hard right-wing country now and condemning that might hurt those who are trying to steer finland into hard right-wing direction. 

Now of course everyone on the right is quickly trying to white-wash their involvent with Russia and all the smart business people who went there to be oligarcs just shrug like "we didn't know Putin was bad, honestly we're just innocent little business men who wanted to be oligarcs and got burned, now vote for me in our elections!"


Finland conviniently forgets all things that could hurt those who own us.

11604 This is why Russian People are not fighting back.

&#x200B;

   Moscow, a mother reported her own daughter to police: Tatyana from Ochakovo-Matveevsky supports Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù, and her daughter doesn‚Äôt.
  
  tyana, 59, decided to discuss Russia‚Äôs involvement in Ukraine with her daughter Irina, who already had heated arguments with other family members about international politics of Vladimir Putin.
  
  e attempt to resolve the conflict backfired. Tatyana and Irina got into such a quarrel that 3 days later the mother, holding a grudge, went to the police and filed an official report on her daughter.
  
  
  ere is no information whether a case has been opened against the girl, but that‚Äôs not the point.
  
  e bottom line is that for the "greatness of the state", the mother denounced her own daughter.
  
  is case highlights the biggest misconceptions about the Russian society.
  
  Family values
  
  e mother is reporting her own child to police, for the ‚Äúcrime‚Äù that can see her daughter thrown into prison for up to 15‚Äì25 years: ‚Äúdiscrediting Russia‚Äôs army‚Äù gets you up to 15 years, and ‚Äútreason‚Äù might see you locked up for life.
  
   Kindness, soulfulness
  
  owing what will happen to a fellow human being, Russians are eagerly denouncing each other ‚Äì including false reports on competitors or as a payback. FSB and police are flooded with reports about citizens speaking against the ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù.
  
   ‚ÄúAll Russians support Putin‚Äù
  
  ere are plenty of Russians who don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs dangerous to speak against the ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù, but people still do it, even now ‚Äì 14 months after its start, in the oppressive political climate of 2023 Russia.
  
  new leaked conversation between, allegedly, billionaire Roman Trotsenko (wallet of Igor Sechin's, who is an oil magnate, a close ally and "de facto deputy" of Vladimir Putin) and Nikolai Matushevsky (creator of popular art spaces in Moscow) is sending shock waves through Russian elites once again.
  
  
  e two men talk about the need to withdraw all funds from Russia by the end of 2023, or it will be too late: ‚ÄúPeople will be slaughtered in the streets of Moscow,‚Äù they grimly predict.
  
  verything is crushing in Russia,‚Äù they feel.
  
  e processes happening in Russia are about the civilizational divide. The civilization of freedom and unfreedom are fighting in an existential battle.
  
  e old generation is scared of freedom, because freedom means taking responsibility for one‚Äôs own choices and taking action.
  e young generation, which tasted the freedoms and seen the world, feels suffocated in the atmosphere of the tightening oppression.
  at‚Äôs one of the most disastrous aspects of Putin‚Äôs regime: all Russians suffer from PTSD as individuals and as a nation. They are psychologically deformed.
  
  fe of ordinary Russians was so hard, so full of traps, the dangers to each citizen were so real, that it brought out the worst in people.
  
  ople's usual lives literally collapsed, their souls and hearts were smashed. They were easy to manipulate psychologically, it could be done by a snap of fingers.
  
  is largely explains the phenomenon of mass Stockholm syndrome among Russians.
  
   Soviet times, people believed in the ‚Äúbright future‚Äù, trying to overcome ‚Äúbourgeoise backwardness‚Äù.
  
   Putin‚Äôs times, they believe in ‚Äúthe bright past‚Äù, which can be brought back by locking the future into prison.
  
  
  e Russian society and Russian people of today aren‚Äôt the same people they were 2 years ago. Or a year ago. Or even 2 months ago. They are being broken weekly, daily, to deeper submission.
  
  t slaves don‚Äôt love their master. Loyalty based on fear and enforcement, loyalty purchased by money, is false loyalty.
  
  ssia isn‚Äôt North Korea. It will never be North Korea. Nor it can plunge into Stalin‚Äôs times.
  
  tler promised his people the Third Reich, a bunch of slaves and the prosperity of the German people.
  e Soviets promised sweet life under communism, when everything would be free.
  tin‚Äôs propagandists can only promise Stalin‚Äôs repressions and electronic draft notices to sacrifice your life for Putin‚Äôs oligarchs.
  d this is why everyone in Russia is feeling that life as they knew it, is crashing. That‚Äôs why they are filled with anxiety and fear.
  
  at‚Äôs why they all, from the regular folk to high-ranking officials, want an end to this giant uncertainty, any end that brings back common sense and predictability. They are more ready for Russia‚Äôs defeat than they are ready for a victory, because ‚Äúvictory‚Äù brings more issues, expenses and deaths.
  
  e decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan, after 9 years, was due to the Red Army‚Äôs failure to suppress Afghan fighters, and the high cost in Russian lives and resources.
  
  ‚Äôs been 9 years since Putin attacked Ukraine in 2014. The cost in Russian lives and resources is mounting.
  
The end result is predictable, and when it happens, everyone will say, ‚ÄúI knew it! It just couldn‚Äôt be any different.‚Äù

> In statements to the semi-official Cyprus News Agency, Cypriot police spokesman Christos Andreou said authorities had no indication the fire was caused by a device thrown at the building, such as a petrol bomb.
> 
> The fire broke out around noon in the complex, which is in the heart of the commercial centre of Nicosia, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky. It was contained in just under two hours.
> 
> The centre, which was being renovated, is thought to have strong links to the Russian embassy in Cyprus, and is a popular venue for art exhibitions, movie screenings and plays.
> 
> Yevgeny Primakov, head of Rossotrudnichestvo, the Russian government's cultural promotion agency, said foul play was clearly responsible, TASS reported.

I was thinking it was probably arson until I read the official Russian statement, that and the fact that it was being renovated has me leaning towards careless smoking.

One thousand percent if Russia tries any nuclear weapons it means the non-existence of Russia, full stop. Don‚Äôt have to try to make the rest of the world fear any further, Russians, putin and medvedev will be gone. Let them think about that first before they try to make us ‚Äúfear‚Äù anything, they are still people who care about their own existence. This is just bluster.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11719 fuck that. it won't solve anything. the only way that any kind of lasting peace can come to Eastern Europe is if Russia is fucking annihilated as a state. I genuinely believe that so long as Russia exists, there can be no real peace in the East. it's a nation with a political history of barbarians beating everyone around them into submission. the ONLY reason Russia still exists is the Nukes they supposedly have still, but knowing the shit state of the Russian military and how poorly it has been maintained, I can't be at all certain that all of Russia's nuclear arsenal is Fissile (nuclear warheads have an expiration date without proper maintenance). due to that uncertainty, if we can prove that Russia's nuclear arsenal is caput, I say yes, NATO should go in, destroy the Russian government, give the eastern half of Russia to China to make them not complain, then figure out how to make whatever's left stable. Russia has a LOT of empty space, and due to sheer incompetence and corruption on the part of the Russian state, is underdeveloped as FUCK. developing the underdeveloped parts of Russia would go a long way to stabilizing a post-war Occupied Russia. I don't give a fuck it would cost many billions of Dollars to develop all that, I want long-term stability in Eastern Europe and that's what it would take since the Russians clearly can't do it themselves. I genuinely believe this. it would be costly as fuck, take decades to finish, and make China more powerful as part of the deal to keep them from objecting, but I'll take an empowered China if it means Russia isn't a threat to the West anymore.

 Russia: Internal Politics , post

I wonder what could have caused such an event. Truly, what an enigma. Must be horrible for those poor Russian oligarchs to realize that the disparity in fire power is becoming more and more obvious.

It actually sucks that we have to be spending money on militarization rather than use it for something useful like medicine, schools, fighting climate change, decreasing poverty and so on. But, well, you can't have nice things with neighbours like Russia around.

11804 Russian opposition news sources report that a new draft wave is already underway, and with a vengeance. In previous waves the authorities mostly kept to the more remote regions. Saturday morning there was apparently a sweep of student housing in Moscow, with students rounded up and driven to military recruitment offices at 9 am. 

Traditionally University students in Russia are exempt from the military draft. Those who have been whisked away and forcibly drafted were confident they were exempt. 

Sources show screenshots of a group chat where one of these students was trying to contact a lawyer about his exempt status, then posted "that's it, I'm going to the army" and has not posted anything since. 

Other Moscow students also report receiving mass conscription notices delivered personally to their door. In some cases the notices are accompanied by burly cops who handcuff the draftees and take them away. 

Note that this is conscription, not mobilization. Conscription is for the younger men who had never had basic training. A mobilization is for those who had already been conscripted previously, considered "ready for combat". Of course with Putin's freshly signed legislation the lines between the two are blurred. 

> According to the coordinator of the "Movement of Conscious Objectors", human rights activists did not expect raids at the beginning of the draft.

> ‚ÄúTraditionally, such raids take place somewhere after the May holidays,‚Äù the human rights activist says. "I have a suspicion that now they are trying to fulfill the conscription plan faster, so they can fully focus on the [second wave] of mobilization. Because it is too much for them [to deal with] both the flow of mobilized and the flow of conscripts at the same time.‚Äù

11806 Sweden expels five Russian Embassy staff suspected of spying.

Sweden has informed Russia that five employees have been asked to leave the Russian Embassy in Stockholm on suspicion of spying. 

Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said in a statement that their activities were "incompatible" with their diplomatic status. 

Sweden's SAPO domestic security agency said "every third Russian diplomat in Sweden is an intelligence officer". 

How many diplomats from Russia are officially assigned to Sweden is unclear.

It is not the first time Sweden has removed Russian Embassy staff, after expelling thee workers last year. 

It also comes nearly two weeks after neighbouring Norway said it was expelling 15 Russian diplomats, who the country said were spies.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11841 How much money do you think Wagner group makes? They are a private corporation after all, and I hardly see anyone talking about their potential finances. Russia spent about $70 billion on its military in 2021. This was for just over a million troops, corresponding to about $70,000 per troop. Given Wagner pays higher salaries than the Russian military, and they engage in more active combat, it's reasonable to assume each Wagner soldier costs ~$100,000 per year. Multiply that by 40,000 Wagner troops, and you get $4 billion. Add a 20% profit margin, and you have a company making $4.8 billion a year in revenue. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Russia), this would make Wagner the 46th largest company in Russia by revenue. They'd also have $800 million in income. If Wagner did an IPO and got a P/E ratio of 40, the company would be worth $32 billion. If Prigozhin owns the majority of Wagner's stock, this could actually make him the [richest person in Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_billionaires).

11855 I think that Chechens want to be massacred by a second east slavic group. I mean, poor people. They have to fight for a country that literally razed their capital, and are going to fight in the bloodiest scenario of the war. Some really are unlucky.

11862 1- Prigozhin knows that after capturing Bakhmut, the Wagner will be irrelevant. It is a phyric victory for Wagner that decimated it's forces. They will never be able to recover to their former strength. So Bakhmut is all he got left to bargain with Moscow.

2- He is not asking for ammunition. He is probably asking something else that we don't know that is concealed in a threat of leaving Bakhmut reasoning lack of ammunition.

11869  Prigozhin explicitly announced the termination of PMC Wagner's participation in the war effective immediately, citing the loss of battle-worthiness due to significant losses caused (he claims) by MoD's artificial throttling of supply of munitions to Wagner 

 Says only 10% of required rounds provided to Wagner as of May 1 (down from 30% as of 2023), leading to unsustainable losses. Says remaining troops will be parked for recovery and retraining at bases in Russia "until danger to Russia is gone". Awkward.

The third terrorist attack in Russia, if it remains without a lightning-fast and bloody response, then I will begin to believe that I will cope with ensuring the security of the people and the defense of the country better than the workers who are entrusted with this duty.

Fucking faggots, you are to blame for these terrorist attacks, the leaders of the law enforcement agencies and security services, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the Foreign Intelligence Service. I will not blame crests for this, they are not the subject of thoughts and decisions. They are just a phenomenon that you MUST fight. Personally, they owe it to me, to every passer-by on the street, to every citizen of the Russian Federation, because any citizen of the country is your boss and employer. Each such terrorist attack is evidence of a criminal act committed by you, which resulted in the death of a person and created a threat to state security. Each terrorist attack left without a bloody and crushing response is the creation of fertile ground for dozens of such attacks.

You are guilty, the crime is obvious.

If I am blown up in the capital of my country by Khokhlyat meat sucking Jews, then I

I say in advance, as I always said, that the mothers of my killers are prostitutes. And on behalf of honest Russian people, I will ask that a memorial plaque always stand next to my tombstone, listing the names of the heads of all departments responsible for ensuring my safety, and next to each name there is an inscription: ‚ÄúFaggot, cocksucker and accomplice of the enemy who is guilty of betraying Russia and the death of another Russian person.

But politically, the optics aren‚Äôt great for everyone involved. You can be sure that Kadyrov will want to make a big show of capturing the city, with Preggo certainly wouldn‚Äôt want. Maybe he‚Äôs betting on the counteroffensive and letting big Heffe Chechen take the onslaught?

11902 This has been rhe case since day 1. On r/combatfootage it was noticeable that a 100k or so joined  and I'd bet 99.9% were purely pushing super pro UA anti Russian material. It became fashionable at one time to talk about russians like people talked about black people 200 years ago.

It all seemed too much. People were emotive but I long thought this was a huge pys op. Talk to people that don't follow the war or follow it from Feb 2022 and they have no idea what's going on or why. It's simply putin is a lunatic. Ukraine the Disney Prince.

I'll be honest we get what we deserve tbh. We've given up our brains to the government. Now fewer and fewer people ask why and those that do are painted as nutters and conspiracy theorists (how often a conspiracy theory becomes conspiracy fact after enough time for the heat to go our of a subject)

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11933 I don't think it worth the task to transcribe all eight minutes of the speech, but after casually perusing the comments I think it worth mentioning some of the main talking points:

1. First and foremost, the main goal of the message is Kadyrov appealing to Prigozhin to go talk out his differences with Shoigu; they need to reach an understanding.
2. Kadyrov wanted to make a point on the unity of Russia.  There are two very similar words in Russian one meaning an Ethnic Russian (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π) and one being a Russian National (–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π); I think Kadyrov fumbled a bit about this point, because on the one hand he emphasized that Russia is a multi-national country with many ethnicities and both Muslims and Christians, but he also expressed that A) Russians are the majority ethnicity and head the government B) The main reason of SMO is to defend Russian Ethnic interests (and quickly adds: the interests of our government).  It came off a little strange because while calling for unity, there is a strange detour in emphasizing an inequality between ethnicities and that such inequalities are ok.
3.   But he emphasized the need for unity in order to achieve victory and not lose the progress made by so many sacrifices.  Kadyrov also mentioned that making such public squabbles has a negative affect on the general moral of the country.
4. Kadyrov reminds Prigozhin that not having enough supplies and not having things go according to plan are part of war (or as he awkwardly put it "part of special military operations" lol, double think in action!).  He recounts that when Akhmat was taking Mariupol they requested 4 tanks but only got 1, and at some point the crew of that tank ran away and had to be brought back by Akhmat and "be made" to do their job and hit certain targets.
5. Several times Kadyrov refers to Prigozhin as a brother and towards the end of his talk even says that if Prigozhin still decides to withdraw, that he (Kadyrov) will take the place in Bakhmut like a younger brother covering for his sibling.  Kinda of a way "if you really need this bro, then you can rely on your younger brother to cover for you while you take time to do your thing".

My impressions and first thoughts are either:

A) Kadyrov is genuinely trying to publicly call for unity and resolve these upper level quarrels on his own as a fairly autonomous actor in Russian strongman politics. 

B) Kadyrov was ordered/hinted by Putin to try and do damage control.  His strange tangent on "United but some are more Equal" (as well as mentioning that Chechens are there by order of the head commander) seem to go out of his to signal loyalty to his master (though, I always that it was Putin barely keeping Chechnya on a leash by paying Kadyrov).  Not to mentioned strict adherence to SMO vs War distinction.

C) This is all staged drama and part of the Prigozhin trolling/mind games.

I'm pro-discourse ya'll!

11944 "Shoigu and Gerasimov are responsible for tens of thousands of dead and wounded" - Prigozhin

Wagner is spent in Bakmut, and Prigozhin wants to find someone to blame. His written statement indicates as much since his list of grievances goes all the way back to 2022. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11945 Prigozhin makes a compelling point and it‚Äôs refreshing to see the inner workings even if not entirely accurate. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs similar grievances on the UA side regarding resources and support. However, Shoigu and Gerasimov have to defend the entire line against 100‚Äôs thousands of opponents supplied by the most powerful block in the world. He only has one city to worry about. There‚Äôs a finite supply of resources and whatever is not sent to Bakhmut could have a bigger effect elsewhere. He does have a point in losing his men, but that‚Äôs partly on him for sending them to the meat grinder. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11946 So now it‚Äôs confirmed they lost tens of thousands trying to take Bakhmut, straight from the horses mouth.  Just like US intelligence said last week when all the pro-RU mocked those numbers.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way they can know.  They‚Äôre just guessing!‚Äù

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11948 A lot of things can be taken from Prigo's statements, first of all is that despite all bs going on, a PMC cares about their assets and the management of its resources. Contrary to  regular UA and RUS armies that tend to alter the numbers and hide incompetence due all sorts of the well known government shenanigans that happens everywhere.

Also, I think Prigozhin is clearly making political statements aligned to his own political goals, you can clearly see that last videos probably weren't well received by his followers so he was told by his marketing guys to tone it down, talk numbers and give context.

This may seem as an internal conflict among the Russians, however I would be more worried about them being capable of having internal dissidence, because that usually leads to changes that may end up being beneficial for the Russian war efforts. Let's not forget that Russians know how to adapt and overcome, and such things cannot be possible if there's not internal criticism of everything that is being done wrong.

Ukraine could use some people to point out such things, however they seem completely hypnotized by the western propaganda spell.

11958 I think we would be wise to not over analyze this. I think he's telling the truth and it would seem that the in-fighting among MOD and Wagner would give credence to his statements. Whether he'll actually leave on May 10 is another thing. More likely they'll just retreat a bit to stronger fortifications, dig in and not try to attack any more. 

But this statement puts immense pressure on MOD and if this doesn't get Putin's attention, nothing will. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11959 I just came here to read everybody's 'thoughts' on all of this.  There are some wildly entertaining anecdotes/theories in the comment section.

Just to clear things up, as we all know Prigozhin is a man of many talents, a go getter who is capable in any situation.  Having commanded one of the worlds largest PMC's he has now decided to move onto more important matters.  Pulling his boys out of Bakhmut and shifting focus from combat to extended car warranties.  Y'all better watch out, you no long have a choice if you want to renew or not.  God bless him.  He has risen! 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11960 I never trust a word this guy says it's all information warfare. Let's see what they are angling for with this, considering they had taken 90% of the city it seems strange for them to now pull out. I think Prigozhin is just trying to cause confusion with this.

11964 They aren't gonna leave Bakhmut, this is just another call by Prigozhin to the Ministry of Defense to get given more weapons.

11972 You can't make discussion posts which is really dumb so I'll just ask here.  

Is it possible Russia is simply running low on artillery shells and that's why wagner is not getting what they need?

11980 With Prickozhin like most other ruZZians, all you have to do is read between the lines of what they are actually saying to realise that they are lying and the opposite of what they say is true.

So no. Neither he nor Wagner will be leaving Bakhmut on May 10th, unless driven out by UAF. But that is unlikely to happen in that time frame.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11984 If this turns out to be true (you never know with Prigozhin), it would be an absolutely fatal sign for Wagner and the situation in Bachmut in general. After all, the conquest of the city would have been the first significant success for Russia since the summer of 2022; therefore Wagner has put 90% of their resources of the last ~9 months into the conquest of the city. The MoD could now declare victory for themselves instead. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11985 Headline is missing some context Prigozhin said he will hand it over to regular Russian forces. That being said I think Wagner got forced out of Bakhmut so they don't get the PR victory of capturing Bakhmut themselves dick move by RU MOD after Wagner did all the heavy lifting or this could be Prigozhin blackmailing MoD supply ammo asap or Wagner leaves. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11986 Interesting how much people think this was actually Wagners/Prigozhins call too make. Personally I think the RU MoD is done with Prigozhin and his antics and now that hes expended his private army too all but capture Bakhmut they get too shelve him and take the glory.

His last video in particular, where he personally insulted the entire chain of command and displayed casualties would've qualified for a court martial and demotion in any other standing army.

Its really a testament to how much the RU needed Wagner to do the heavy lifting that they didn't remove him from the picture earlier tbh, but his role was always going to be limited sooner or later. No where is tall poppy syndrome more blatant then in the ranks of established, nepotistic, corrupt bureaucratic structures like the Russian MoD.

The ideal outcome for Russia is they get too take Bakhmut and on paper maybe a couple hundred Russian army soldiers die (officially) while the thousands of convicts and mercenaries that died get a token gesture of gratitude and promptly forgotten about.

OFC pro-UA crowd will make this act of political infighting and dissent sound like the Russians are retreating from Bahkmut, inevitable collapse, Crimea any day etc. But its a lot more cold and calculated then that imo (I could be wrong).

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
11989 This could be Wagner's "Mission Accomplished" moment. They must be desperate to find an exit, it cannot be possible to maintain morale for the horrendously difficult and dangerous job they have been doing thus far. There is no sense in driving them to their breaking point. The Russian General Staff have to come up with a proper exit strategy for Wagner.

12009 Whoever was in charge of logistical support was removed few days ago, so hopefully new guy will be able to resolve whatever issues there are, but if Prigozhin really did care about 9th of May he would have made this statement after it, not few days before. Whatever achievements his company made his problems started after he used taking of Soledar for his personal advertisement. Doing this sort of thing right now is a cheap trick and a nail in his coffin. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12010 I like Yevgeny Prigozhin , and I think he's proven to be a formidable commander. But I also think he has aspirations for high political office in Russia and I take all his public statements with that in mind. Though, it's quite possible some of the RF commanders were jealous of Wagner's success and would work to undermine their supplies to clip their wings a bit.

12018 Love me some utterly pissed off Yev. I do find myself having some sort of strange fascination with Prigozhin, purely as an eccentric character amidst this unimaginable nightmare. Can't deny his tenacity and determination, irrespective of whether or not you think he's the human embodiment of a used condom 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12019 At this point I don't think you can say he's acting or trolling. He's publicly insulting the RU MoD in front of his (large) audience. 

I'm doubtful they'd let him go that far if that was "part of the plan". 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12020 You got to respect the fact this guy doesn't sugarcoat losses like literally everyone else in this war. But it's hard to imagine him lasting much longer challenging the chain of command like this.

For all he knows they're stockpiling ammo for the Ukrainian counter offensive, or maybe they simply don't have enough to spare with all the other fronts Russia's engaged in. 

Either way it's not a good sign of such break down in command where field commanders are openly challenging the upper ranks. PMC or not they're still part of the Russian military structure at this stage and obviously dependent on it.

I don't think it's a sign of an inevitable breakdown of the Russian army or civil war like some delusional UA posters insinuate, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the prospect of future offensive action from the Russians. I can't imagine them enduring another Bakhmut. 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12021 I think Shoigu is doing this for personal reasons. He owns his own PMC, Patriot, which is nowhere to be seen. I think he feels embarrassed that Wagner has much more success. So he uses his power to deprive the PMC Wagner from getting the resources it really needs.

Here's the thing about oligarchs on both sides, they just sit comfortably in their million dollar mansions, while everyday people fight for their lives. It's unfortunate how things are. Oligarchs in the Western world("entrepreneurs") do the same shit.

In my opinion, Mr. Prigozhin would be a fitting replacement for Mr. Shoigu. I hold Mr. Prigozhin in high regard for his forthrightness and lack of concern for Russian authorities. He is only loyal to the president and his nation and will take all necessary measures for his private military company.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12024 It might just be Prigozhin looking for someone to blame for not being able to capture Bakhmut in time for Victory day celebrations. He thought it was going to be his time to shine and is genuinely pissed off. I don't think this is an act at all.

But it is also entirely possible that Shoigu and Gerasimov are not too happy at the thought of Prigozhin offering Bakhmut to Putin on a silver platter and are actually putting a stoke in his wheel by not delivering enough shells to Wagner. Now that he's done his part and captured most of Bakhmut, the Russian army which is in direct competition with Wagner would probably be quite happy to have the remaining Wagner outfit bled white because they have served their purpose. This wouldn't be the first time in history that there is some infighting within the armed forces of a belligerent in a conflict.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12028 Seems to me like hes putting on a performance for the camera, deflecting blame away from the fact he's responsible for this mess. He threw an army of convicts into a meat grinder and is now acting like the reason theyve been dying in such high numbers and have been stalled in the same tiny settlement for 8 months is due to an ammo shortage and not because this fool has no other plan but to send human waves to their deaths and hope for the best. 

Fools in this subreddit fall for his propaganda so easily. "He cares, he tells it how it is, he's calling out the moron elites." No, he doesn't care about the dead and disposable Russian fodder, he tells it how he wants to frame it, and he is a moron elite himself. But convincing some people otherwise seems rather easy for him.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12031 This is the same nonsense Russia has done for over 100 years. Strongmen warlords using dead men to jockey for political leverage. How many coups, assassinations, betrayals, mock trials, and house arrests must happen before ordinary Russians step up and end this? Cause I gotta tell ya, the entire world is sick of it spilling over and becoming our problem.

Prigozhin is no different. He's just using a PMC and social media. Any objectively intelligent PMC commander would never give his soldiers a mission they couldn't complete. They would also never agree to action without guarantees regarding supplies and logistics.

But Prigozhin isn't that is he? He's an ex-con gangster who's using death to gain a foothold into Russian political life. The same as FSB spooks, internal police, and military goons who line their pockets in a lawless society. Including the manlet who's calling the shots right now.

I hope Russia loses this war, not because I like seeing Russians suffer, but because their entire society needs a wake-up call that their own incompetent leaders are why they were defeated.

12038 Controlled opposition. Prigozhin is seen as the outsider working on behalf of the common soldier. Meanwhile, using expendable troops they were able to capture most of Bakhmut. That left the professional troops to shore up other areas while the cauldron kept boiling in Bakhmut. This is just a bit of theater to muddy the waters and pretend that there is more going on behind the scenes than there actually is. These types of actions build Prigozhin up and helps his image to continue recruitment efforts. It makes it seem like he is fighting on behalf of every soldier under his command. But, that's his role.

12117 F. hypocrite. It was ok to attack other countries while Russia had 20-100x forces advantage, but when they failed they are ready to use nuclear weapons, even though the only benefit they get will be to show off "undefeatable rus'". They don't care about civilians, captives, even their own. They care only about the victory by any means.

All these pro - Russian supporters here are the same hypocrites, who are no better than Hitler's supporters, whatever they're saying about NATO, US hegemony or other blah blah blah.

This war has nothing to do with "justice" on the Russian side.

12120 the one thing i don't understand is, did putin just decide against it, or did really no russian so far have the idea to detonate a nuke high up above ukraine and fry the electronics in all those elon musk satellites?

12143 100%. Putin did this with the Moscow apartments to rally support before invading Chechneya. This is right out of Putins playbook. When Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya wrote the truth about the chechen invasion and the moscow apartments, putin had her assassinated

This is putin trying to keep the propaganda machine rolling, to keep Russians motivated for their illegal invasion of Ukraine. Also why would Ukraine do it when they risk losing all support from the US? 
 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12144 This is one of the dumbest things I've heard lately. Hitting Kremlin's roof with a drone is one of the few ways to "attack" Moscow and NOT "bring the war home". There's no damage, no casualties, you literally can't come up with a worse way to rile up Russian citizens.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12222 Best guess here is these are Russian partisans, possibly anarchists or some new remake of the SR combat org doing this. Russia has a long tradition of such revolutionary orgs.

Either way the drone isn‚Äôt of the exploding variety, it seems made to catch a fire.

Before you all downvote me, why would ukraine show their hand early, it would be better for them to try and do it on the parade day as it's all on TV and would be even more embarrassing to putin, imagine if he was in the middle of his speech and this happened, not a good look.

There have been reports of russia cancelling the parades over concerns of safety and this just backs up the legitimacy of those safety concerns

12235 By Russian standards I think he got off lightly, if a video apology is as far as this goes. 

He‚Äôs not been sent to rot in some prison cell, he‚Äôs not been conscripted, he‚Äôs not had his citizenship revoked, he‚Äôs been taught a valuable life lesson: actions and words have consequences. Sometimes, silence is golden. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got nothing nice to say, don‚Äôt say anything‚Äù Going live on camera during a time of war and basically saying you are with the enemy is about as sensible as glueing yourself to a busy motorway. 

Before anyone jumps in and calls me delusional/stupid/inconsiderate or whatever just remember there is a known partisan movement working against the Russian state, especially in the occupied areas of ukraine. Ya know, planting bombs, assassinating local officials, spying for ukraine, that type of thing. Actions generally considered treasonous. 

That statement alone puts him right at the top of an FSB watchlist for obvious reasons. He would‚Äôve been pulled in for questioning, worked out to be just some kid that gave it billy big boll0cks in front of his friends, made to apologise on camera and let go.

12249 Sure is a whole lot of no damage for putin apparently "surviving a drone assassination attempt".

Seems like it was either staged by Russia itself 


Or

Ukraine making a point that Moscow's overall sense of invulnerability is false.

Why else would a drone fly 100km into Russian occupied airspace over one of the apparently single most protected areas of airspace in the world only to self detonate 10-50 meters above the target. As there was no AA fire or countermeasures used to take it down from all the footage we've seen.

Not to mention that it was highly unlikely Putin was even in the building. 

Saying putin "survived" an assassination attempt that left no visible structural damage to speak of is maybe just being a bit melodramatic isn't it?

Either way this is an embarrassment for the defence forces in Moscow. This would be like a Shahed suicide drone flying over the white House in the USA unopposed before exploding above it causing no damage to speak of. It makes Russia look weak to the international community so perhaps it isn't staged by Russia and instead Russia is pushing the assassination narrative to save face in some way because that drone could've hit its target if it wanted to but it didn't. Unless you count the mild inconvenience of hitting a flag pole an assassination attempt.

Something more grand, not just this weak (and repeated) response which will make Ukrainians more thirsty for killing russian soldiers and us, westerners, more supportive to sending military stuff to Ukraine.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12259 Chicago Typewriter model M1A1 looking like it was made yesterday.

Good thing, since the Orcs got them, is that the ammo would be a bitch to get in volume for them.

 Another good thing for those wanting to buy one  is that with Orcs fimnding them, they will all be out for sale in a couple of days :p

With none of what they make actually ending up financing Russias armed forces but 5-10 people, who are all about to die anyway. If for one, Prigozhin is alive in 6 months I'm chocked.  And he wont fall down a flight of stairs or from a balcony. 

 There will be no doubt about who killed him in the same way they made sure there was no doubt with Litvinenko in London or Nemtsov who got shot in a drive-by on a bridge 300m from the Kremlin within line of sight.

I bet Prigozhin is earmarked for a similar end, or he has activated an insurance of crazy proportions. A explosive data drop that can't be denied and with the potential to cause serious civil unrest for instance. That decrypts and sends itself to a bunch of news outlets if he doesn't reset a timer every 48h or whatever. I doubt he could've been as aggressive as he has been towards the Kremlin without something like that after all.

Hard to get excited over an acknowledgement of objective reality.  Words have meaning, and Russia committed an act of aggression by invading Ukraine.  The US committed it invading Afghanistan.  India committed it invading East Pakistan to stop a genocide.  None of it is to say the acts are equal, but there's nobody on earth would ever suggest there's never been cause for military intervention, making the bare admittance ideologically and functionally meaningless.

12425 I can personally speak to some of the economic issues in Russia, where I lived from 2010-16.

The first few years, the ruble was super strong. Then over just a few weeks in 2014, it lost half its value. Just like that. In 2014, when the shit first started hitting the fan, there was a brief time when prices hadn‚Äôt been adjusted to the new rate. Russians went out and bought Apple products, gold jewelry, fur coats, cars and apartments. Then they hunkered down and waited for their economy to collapse.

The exchange rate hasn‚Äôt changed much since then, even with the war. Externally, a lot of it was due to various financial gaming and manipulation of the system. Internally, it never really mattered to average Russians because they don‚Äôt invest. They don‚Äôt buy stocks or have retirement plans. Even in white collar jobs, companies lie on paper to the government about what they pay employees so as to avoid paying taxes ‚Äî people get a small amount direct deposited to an employee account registered by the company and the rest in cash under the table. I worked in a few offices and was paid about $400-600 on paper and three times as much under the table. It‚Äôs institutionalized.
Unless you‚Äôre rich and corrupt in a high level job, you‚Äôre keeping your savings in a box under the mattress ‚Äî literally. Myself and many Russian friends and colleagues did the same. 

Russia like most of Eastern Europe is still heavily a cash country. Maybe things have changed a lot since I left but I rarely used my Russian or western debit cards, even if I could at a shop. 

So with all these factors in mind, you can see how Russia has managed to juggle all these balls while the world is seemingly collapsing around it. 

Ukraine is the same way, but much poorer and with a much smaller economy. Unlike Russia, it is completely dependent on other countries. And it can‚Äôt sustain itself with financial trickery as Russia can.

They invaded Latvia in 1940 and then in 1944. After both invasions they were committing atrocities on local population. In 1944 they were no liberators but invaders, composed of drunk, cruel, dirty, criminal mob: the so called Red Army. Now they are using similar mob extracted from russian prisons in Ukraine.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12488 Prigozhin is actually the final boss. Putin has been exiled and the president of russia is Prigozhin the whole time? nah....

reality is that Progozhin is pissed af at the russian MoD, but the other units think that Prigozhin is full of shit and has been allocated more weapons than everybody else. Which they think led to the disastrous assaults on Vulhedar.

Girkin on the other hand seems to be be the most rationally irrational actor in all of this. Prigozhin is delusional, putin is delusional, and then there is girkin...who thinks Putin is a piece of shit failure because he failed to mobilize everybody for the great "patriotic" war.

Girkin and Prigozhin have both said that if Wagner is done, then the entire front will collapse. He's building himself as powerful, Prigozhin has aspirations far greater than what the Kremlin have for him. Despite what you see about Wagner, the Kremlin is NO fan of Prigozhin's way of doing things, the MoD thinks he's draining the rest of the military of recources. The photo he leaked where he posts russia's ammo/wep allocations for their group clearly states how much he needs, how much he got. Commentators quickly called bullshit and said what he asked for was 3x what the other units were allocated.

Prigozhin thinks he DESERVES this because he very frankly thinks that the Russian MoD is a heap of bullshitters who "visit hair salons" (his own words).

Now there have been videos here posted where he goes and "rescues" other PMC groups, like the gazprom guys who he went to go see where he played the "nice uncle" of "this wouldn't have happened under my PMC." You can see there are a lot of divisions forming in Russia, he even said if they just gave him 200,000 men he would have been in Kyiv by now. He wants FULL and total control of all the military.

He's setting the stage for all the die hard girkins and pro-RU military bloggers to completely take his side in all of this. The MoD fears this, they can't directly just choke off wagner, but this is their way of dealing with it. They will let them run their course of being useful in bakhmut and then once again be relegated to dirty work in Africa.

Why would he want everybody on his side? it's simple, he's setting it up so nobody wants to join the "useful pussy shit Russian military, but this great bald messiah who actively fights with his troops" <- NOW THIS is the MoDs greatest fear. Leave the MoD totally drained and then pull the fuck you eject switch mission accomplished now you all go out and FAIL.

I forgot to mention that Putin signed a paper saying he recognizes all those who fought for Russia since 2014. He was FORCED by prigozhin to do this, basically said fuck you all my men are dying here and you haven't recognized any of their sacrifice. Prigozhin has seen death, lots of it.

This is just my take based off following the situation and checking out pro-ru sources to get views from the other side. BUT REALLY, this is all the shit is from Prigozhin and Girkins mouth. NOW it could be a major disinfo campaign because Prigozhin might as well be part of the MoD. There is also speculation that Prigozhin and the Mod are in cahoots to force Ukraine into a fight for Bakhmut so the rest of the russian mobilized get prepared.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12501  Just in from Osechkin: Prigozhin has not been invited to the May 9th Soviet Victory Parade on the Red Square. Wagner PMC will have no presence at the parade in any form whatsoever, including simple attendance.  According to Osechkin's sources, FSB investigators are collecting criminal evidence against Prigozhin and Utkin through interrogations Wagner members. Several Wagner members are already in prison.  Prigozhin claims to have kompromat on Shoigu, Ivanov (deputy Defence Minister), and Tsallikov (deputy Defence Minister) at the Defence Ministry and appears to be blackmailing them.  He has already publicly thrown under the bus several officials who were his accomplices at the MoD , including deputy Defence Minister Mizintsev and Surovikin, former Commander of the Russian forces for invasion of Ukraine demoted back in January 2023. 

 "We are witnessing the process of closing down the Wagner PMC and ending the use of Yevgeny Prigozhin for military purposes. The coming weeks will show a lot. The source reports that dozens of search warrants have already been prepared for Prigozhin's and his associates' residences. There is also information about a series of searches of Wagner PMC members, seizures of unregistered weapons and interrogations about Wagner PMC's war crimes."   It appears the Kremlin and Defence Ministry want to maximally distance themselves from Prigozhin's war crimes.  This begs the question - why wouldn't Prigozhin give up Bakhmut and royally screw over Shoigu and the entire MoD for May 9th? 

 On why Prigozhin publicized Putin spokesman Peskov's son, Nikolai Peskov, as a Wagner PMC mercenary artillerist in Ukraine: It's a made up story and not true, but an attempt by Prigozhin to establish leverage with the power players. He is offering a service to Russian politicians to avoid domestic public criticism of hypocrisy about how their own sons are not serving as soldiers in the war by falsifying their participation as Wagner mercenaries.

12528 Something really wonderful about Russia is the housing. In cities like St. Petersburg there‚Äôs high demand for quality apartment blocks. What interesting is, most prospective tenants look hot for the newly built apartments but rather the old post Russian built apartments. Many of the newly built apartment blocks lack adequate plumbing, electricity, and water filtration. 

So assuming on the off chance Russians actually cared to put up legitimate apartment blocks and not empty husks in place of the former ones the launched iskanders at ‚Äî I really doubt the quality of these buildings. It‚Äôs dubious as to whether Russia cares about the people of Ukraine enough to emplace quality housing en masse for absolutely no pay from them. I‚Äôm sure the quality of newly built apartment blocks in Russia will retain their integrity in Ukraine. I lack no doubts about their ability to reconstruct entire residential neighborhoods from the ground up out of their love for the people of ukraine, their brothers, who they just so happen to bomb mercilessly. Not many people to house anyways when cave their former homes on top of them.

12535 Fake, here is a text from the guys responsible for the incident. On the boat were two  Russian RPO-A Shmel. The guy (Sergey) on the video is a Russian soldier, who went there to chop off fingers to collect the DNA of his dead comrades for their relatives. He begged not to kill him but eventually died on a Russian mine. Irony. Russians mine everywhere, even booby traps inside civilian apartments when retreating. The OP is shitposting.

12537 From seeing what the dude has in his boat and the armband that maybe says ‚ÄûUN‚Äú or something like get the feeling that this might be a Russian spiller that tries to flea or give himself up? Either way didn‚Äôt make sense to attack him, fucking sad.

Edit: looking again the armband seems to be a Z. My point still doesn‚Äôt change tho. Weird situation.

12538 White armbands have been used by Russian soldiers in Kherson. Combine that with the Z and military ordinance, I‚Äôd take the shot too.

12544 RU POV - The head of the defense committee of the State Duma invited the Russians to defend the borders themselves. According to him, this is due to the fact that Russia does not have the ability to protect the borders along the entire perimeter, as it was in the USSR. - Kommersant 
 Russia: Internal Politics , post
12545 USSR had this ability because it was more preoccupied with keeping people inside than stopping the incomers, who were scarce. In communist Poland there were some brave, who avoided conscript military service this way: they crossed the border illegally and claimed that they escaped to the USSR. After return they were qualified and mentally deficient and not suitable for military service. I did not try it as I was afraid that Russians may say: OK, you can stay here.

 Russia: Internal Politics , comment
12619 Yes BOTH sides are "nazis" so what tell me something nee. Also funny how Zelensky is a Jew.
prigozhins Father was a Jew.
Putins most beloved Neighbors were jews, his Highschool Teacher Mina Berliner was a jew who he visitied in 2005 in telaviv and bought her a apartment. Russia‚Äôs Chief Rabbi,Rabbi Berel Lazar, often referred to as ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Rabbi‚Äù is of course too

 Russia‚Äôs Chief Rabbi,Rabbi Berel Lazar, often referred to as ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Rabbi‚Äù, told a remarkable story about the Russian leader, which he heard from Putin himself.¬†‚ÄúWhen he was a young child, he grew up in a very poor family. His parents were always out at work.He was fortunate that the next door neighbor was a Hasidic Jewish family, and they always made sure to invite him over,‚Äù Lazar explained.‚ÄúThey were extremely kind to him, and he realized that not only were they kind to a child that wasn‚Äôt theirs, not only were they kind to a child that wasn‚Äôt Jewish,but they were kind to a child in a time and place when it was dangerous to do that.‚Äù‚ÄúThirty years later, because of the gratitude he felt for that family, and for the respect he felt for the Jewish people as a whole,as deputy mayor of the city of Leningrad, he granted official permission to open the first Jewish school in the city.‚ÄùThe family in Lazar‚Äôs story was that of Anatoly Rakhlin, Putin‚Äôs high-school wrestling coach, a man he considered to be a father-figure and at whose funeral he cried. Putin described the family in his autobiography,First Person.‚Äú(They were) observant Jews who did not work on Saturdays, and the man would study the Bible and Talmud all day long,‚Äù he wrote.‚ÄúOnce I even asked him what he was muttering. He explained to me what this book was and I was immediately interested.‚ÄùPutin‚Äôs Jewish connection was not an anomaly limited to his childhood memories. In 2005, when Putin made an official visit to Israel,he visited his high-school teacher, Mina Yuditskaya Berliner, who lived in Tel Aviv. He even bought her an apartment in the city when he heard she was living in poor conditions.Arkadi and Boris Rotenberg were his judo sparring partners under Coach Rakhlin, and remain his close friends to this day.The Rotenberg‚Äôs are billionaire contractors, and the relationship is mutually beneficial, with the Rotenberg brothers getting government contracts worth many billions of dollars.¬†In fact, Putin has surrounded himself with rich and successful Jews, such as Moshe Kantor (net worth $2.3 billion), Lev Leviev (net worth $1.5 billion),Roman Abramovich (net worth $9.1 billion) and Victor Vekselberg (net worth $13.6 billion). They are all close friends and confidantes of the Russian president, and they are all quite openly Jewish.On the Jewish New Year, celebrated in September, Putin sent a holiday greeting to Rabbi Lazar, wishing the Russian Jewish community a ‚Äúsweet and happy New Year.‚Äù‚ÄúFor centuries, Jewish values inspired lofty ideals,‚Äù Putin wrote.¬†

All I see is a onesided Genocide

12621 I'm corporal Romanov, 22/11/86, military unit 02146, based in Kamenka, Leningrad Oblast. Specialty - shooter. Glory to Ukraine! Putin huilo!

Got family?

Common law marriage, no children. (Says wife's name), 24/03/92.

How did you get here?

She was framed. The Petrozavodsk Police planted drugs on her, with a condition that I would come here to join SMO...

And how is it going?

It's sh\*t. The people in command are fa99ots. Just left us in the field and left. Left us without radio/comms. No tents, no ponchos, block of cigarettes 'Vega' for the whole unit, field rations and water were running out. We were collecting leftover cigarette butts and making joints out of them.

When were you mobilized?

I've signed the contract on April 6, came to Belgorod on April 7, and left for Ukraine the same day. So I've served for a month.

So you are a shooter? What kind of weapon?

AKM

Have you been shooting your AKM?

Nyet

Right face...(turns left first) F\*cking hell, are they teaching you anything in that Russian Army of yours? About face...(turns clockwise instead of counter-clockwise) Which way are you supposed to turn? About face...(turns in opposite direction again) F\*ck me sideways... Left face... Don't fall... What would you like to say to your relatives, and also to current and future fa99ots who are planning to come here?

Don't come here...

Why?

Because our state wreaks havoc here. This is a pointless war, stay home.

Stay home? But they'll be sent here anyway, right? Maybe something has to be done?

Yes, something has to be done. We need a coup in Russia, because our government only thinks about its pockets. We are nobodies for them. We are meat. Don't come to this country. This country is doing good. There are nice people living here. Roads are paved. The settlements here look like the communities for millionaires. They prosper, while we are trying to make another Russia out of this country. Don't come, leave these people alone. Pull out the troops.

What have the Ukrainian Cossacks taught you here?

Glory to Ukraine!

And?

Putin is a fa9!

Not that

Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Heroes! (together): Putin huilo!

12656 Civilian loss of life is tragic, friends and families will never truly recover from this.

Just like the Russian cruise missile attack photos I saw a few hours before this.

This war needs to stop, and only Putin can do so by removing his troops from foreign soil.  Your think after Syria, Iraq, etc it would be obvious that military might alone cannot bring peace.

How many civilians have died now since 2022 in this invasion? One stat I see shows about 7000
..thats more than since 2014. As we've seen both sides have killed civilians, the only way to stop is for Putin to stop his senseless war.

It's great to see people denounce civilian casualties. Now support the only action which will put an end to it.  Stop supporting imperialism and fascism and put both sides to heel about a lasting peace and stop these civilians getting killed.

The man in the brown jacket is calling the police: "I am next to the enlistment office of the Babushkinskiy District, located next to the Okruzhnaya metro station. The enlistment office's employees are forcing the conscript into the backseat of the car. There is a police officer standing idly by... I'd like to request the police squad to come here. Can you send the police over here? I don't want to complain, I want to prevent an unlawful grab of a civilian..."

Was near the location of the pipe bombing four days prior? Wow this must mean the Russians bombed their own pipeline

12695  I believe it was gazprom that blew the pipeline.

they are getting sued to the max by uniper and others for turning of the gas.

So they blew up the gasline to minimize the damages they will have to pay.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/uniper-seeking-billions-euros-compensation-gazprom-2022-11-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/uniper-seeking-billions-euros-compensation-gazprom-2022-11-30/)

They only blew up the gaspipe that they had a contract to transport gas not nordstream 2 where Germany did not allow it to open.

Gazprom has most money to gain in blowing up the gaspipeline.

US/Norway where already ramping up and selling gas as russia did not allow gazprom to sell gas with the price cap so they had less to gain but a lot to loose if they got caught.

Gazprom had everything to gain but nothing to loose as they where already being sued for breach of contract, getting caught would not make them worse of.

12696 this information was public one year ago

but i guess People did not wanted to see it

but i guess people did not wanted to believe and say Russia would never explode a pipeline that was not going to be used again and that only paid 51% and was more than payed 

and once again Kremlin said its not Russia, it was someone else 

how many people in this same sud-reddit said that 

its the us

its the UK

its Ukraine

&#x200B;

so all of those went there and exploded the pipeline with Russian ships there and the Russians saw nothing, that is even worst, what sonar are they running 

&#x200B;

lets see

 First on CNN: European security officials observed Russian Navy ships in vicinity of Nord Stream pipeline leaks

 Thu September 29, 2022 

 

European security officials on Monday and Tuesday observed Russian Navy support ships in the vicinity of leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines likely caused by underwater explosions, according two Western intelligence officials and one other source familiar with the matter.

It‚Äôs unclear whether the ships had anything to do with those explosions, these sources and others said ‚Äì but it‚Äôs one of the many factors that investigators will be looking into.

Russian submarines were also observed not far from those areas last week, one of the intelligence officials said.

Three US officials said that the US has no thorough explanation yet for what happened, days after the explosions appeared to cause three separate and simultaneous leaks in the two pipelines on Monday.

Russian ships routinely operate in the area, according to one Danish military official, who emphasized that the presence of the ships doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that Russia caused the damage.

 But the sightings still cast further suspicion on Russia, which has drawn the most attention from both European and US officials as the only actor in the region believed to have both the capability and motivation to deliberately damage the pipelines.

US officials declined to comment on the intelligence about the ships on Wednesday.

Both Denmark and Sweden are investigating, but a site inspection has yet to be done and details on exactly what caused the explosions remains sketchy. One European official said that there is a Danish government assessment underway and it could take up to two weeks for an investigation to properly begin because the pressure in the pipes makes it difficult to approach the site of the leaks ‚Äî although another source familiar with the matter said the probe could begin as soon as Sunday.

The prime ministers for both Denmark and Sweden said publicly on Tuesday that the leaks were likely the result of deliberate actions, not accidents, and Sweden‚Äôs security service said in a statement Wednesday that it cannot be ruled out ‚Äúthat a foreign power is behind it.‚Äù US national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday evening also called the leaks ‚Äúapparent sabotage‚Äù in a tweet.

But senior Western officials have so far stopped short of attributing the attack to Russia or any other nation.

The Kremlin has publicly denied striking the pipelines. A spokesman called the allegation ‚Äúpredictably stupid and absurd.‚Äù

CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on the presence of the ships.

12697 Nobody believes the Russians destroyed their own infrastructure when all they had to do was shut off the spigot and keep it off if they really didn't want to supply the gas - which they actually do for the revenue but can't due to sanctions, and **the fact someone blew up their pipeline**.

12703 Oh no, so the 5:1 ratios reported by western inteligence services are true.

Who would have guessed that the most reliable sources of intel, that literally predicted the war 3 months prior, would have been more or less accurately reporting figures.

This will get some people seething hard, but it is what it is.

Anyway, looks like he is setting up the ground for a possible reverse of the Bakhmut situation, pointing fingers already?

America should be building these Soviet style blocks around major cities. I lived in a bunch when I spent time in Russia. While they‚Äôre utilitarian, they‚Äôre actually not bad for most people.

They are not against "both evils". It is just convenient to say so at the moment, cause NATO is not participating in some raging high-intensity occupation/invasion right now.

I might be against this guy if he is pro-RU. But I am all for what he is saying, cause he is right. Same way I am anti-Lukashenko but pro-whatever he said about nukes in Europe.

I mean I will say the same things "doesnt justify Russia now, yes NATO bad too" whenever someone brings up NATO after I say Russia invasion bad, but the others/the majority of those who do so are acting out of bad faith. This NATO shilling needs to stop.

EDIT: Translated he is basically summing up countries in the beginning that NATO bombed and then says this blood symbolises all the children and innocents killed by NATO forces in those countries. Last part is him thanking everyone for coming and saying he hopes people will understand and that NATO has no place in his peaceful country.

I've been to Georgia several times in the last couple of years, and it's full of Russians. Russians who drive around in G-Wagons and stay at the hilton, mind you.

This month I was at a training in France and there were several Russians. One was living in Dubai since last March. Their employer pulled out all the staff. Resettled 200 people from Moscow to Dubai, helped with visas, the lot. Another case was from a consulting company who relocated several hundred staff from Russia to the EU, Turkey etc.

Thousands of qualified, high earning people gone. That's their best and brightest, and their economy will feel it soon. Look at their deficits. Add all the people getting killed and companies pulling out. If this war continues much longer, it really will be a wasteland and the Federation could break up.

12813 When PMC Wagner started to make a name for itself as a very competent fighting force, an !d!0+ Rooskie General decided he would make a name for himself too. The !d!0+ Russian General sent a huge column of armor to storm Uglidar. The !d!0+ Russian General got a lot of Russian soldiers killed for nothing.

Since then, the whole bunch of !d!0+ Russian Generals decided to wipe Uglidar from the face of the earth. 

No one knows why they didn't simply lay siege to the city and bypass it and cut it off from resupply.

12816 "Met with the Head of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation. With dear BROTHER Anton Eduardovich Vaino, we discussed issues of domestic policy, the interaction of the region with the federal center and topical issues.

I am very grateful to Anton Eduardovich not only for his professional qualities, but also for his personal ones, for his sensitivity to problems in the regions, responsiveness and genuine, firm patriotism. This is actually a person who sincerely worries about the future of Russia and every day performs a huge amount of work."

12822 You shouldn't take this guy seriously. After the death of Vladimir Zhirinovsky he became the next state sponsored clown. The reason he says all those things is just so Putin looks so much better in comparison.

13317 The Bear with the eyes of a Fiend 
 Personal War Stories , post
13318 In the shadow of the great forest, where the trees whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a menace‚Äîa hulking, fearsome beast whose presence haunted the dreams of the village folk. 

A vicious bear, black as the heart of a moonless night, his eyes a fiery, bloodthirsty crimson. He had taken the land for his kingdom, ruled by terror and dread, and every soul who dared breathe near the woods shivered with fear.

The air was heavy with an uneasy silence, broken only by the guttural barks and growls of the monstrous invader. 

One fateful night, as the village slept, the beast broke through the fragile barriers of their sanctuary. The timbers cracked and splintered like the bones of the innocent, and the ruthless creature prowled with a singular purpose.

He tore through homes with the ease of ripping parchment, his mighty claws leaving nothing but devastation in their wake. Each room a testament to the unyielding power of the fearsome behemoth. 

The walls, once adorned with the precious relics of memories, were now smeared with the ink of despair.

With a grip like iron, the beast dragged the villagers from their warm embrace of slumber, tearing families apart like delicate petals from a rose. Their screams, carried by the wind, echoed through the forest, painting the darkness with the chilling hue of a nightmare. And as the bear's breath curdled the air, it whispered a dreadful lullaby of terror and anguish.

No treasure was safe from his grasp. The relics of the village, the symbols of their once-thriving culture, were stripped away, replaced by a void as vast and cold as the endless depths of the sea. He stole their laughter and songs, leaving only the taste of loss most bitter.

The land was now shrouded in a cloak of despair, every leaf, every stone touched by the shadow of the beast. The village, once a vibrant tapestry of life, had become a hollow shell of its former self, smothered by the relentless grip of the dark oppressor.

Yet, amidst the rubble and the ruins, the embers of hope refused to be extinguished. The villagers, though battered and bruised, clung to the promise of a brighter day, a time when the shackles of tyranny would be cast off and their homeland would be free once more. For within their hearts, the fire of resilience burned bright, a beacon of light that could not be dimmed by the blackest night or the fiercest storm.

The villagers united in purpose, to kill the beast. Taking up arms they rushed forth and valiantly hunted the foul creature, they were unafraid. Their arms and armor dashed against the fiend and it ran in fear, once, twice, and again and again until it were dead. They would never stop until the light of freedom dawned for all who live in the yellow field under the bluest of sky.

14859 This is how they found him before he was pressed into service, nothing new. 
 Personal War Stories , comment
14860 The kids claiming he was taking a crap that fill about a quarter of the comments on reddit and youtube seem pretty low IQ. Do you really take your trousers entirely off and also your shoes entirely off to take a crap? Obviously not, use your brain a bit more dumb kids. There are dumb kids even claiming it's toilet paper trailing behind him (really dummies, you think you would have toilet paper strongly attached to both your feet while you run away?), this isn't toilet paper you literal mental midgets, they are his foot wraps (these work similar to socks). 

He clearly wasn't taking a crap. Instead, there are 2 actual situations here that are likely. One is that his trousers and shoes somehow got wet, and he was trying to dry them. The second is that he was actually engaged in homosexual activity with another Russian soldier in that hole (yeah, sorry to let you kids down, but homosexuality isn't that uncommon, it's a very likely possibility that this is in fact what was happening there, a bunch of these Wagner and soldiers are also convicts who were let out to be conscripted to fight in the war, and homosexuality is really common in prison as well, making this situation even more probable).

BUT it still feels like a win. Have a drink today, and buckle up to fight again tomorrow.

edit: and if this causes Fox to hemorrhage viewers (we'll see), it could eventually force the network to either re-vamp and come back to reality, or fold their commentary element all together. and THAT would be a win worth toasting. 
 Economic Administration , comment
15539 I try to let all humans have a opinion even if it differs from mine. I truly believe that most things don't have a "truth" and that truth is subjective. There are many truths to most situations. I think of myself as a very open minded person who actually accepts that other people are in entire different universes and live differently than I do.

With all this being said I can't help but to say, FUCK TUCKER CARLSON. He is such a absolute shit bag. I can't stand him or Fox news.

You may be asking why I can go from "the truth is subjective" to this stance. 

The reason being is they really take a story that I could understand their side of the story with and inject their awful personalities into. 

There is literally a lot of things they say that I would normally understand where they're coming from despite not agreeing with them and they just make it so negative and hostile 

Yuck, good riddance bruh

15540 CNN also fired Don Lemon too. Two of the probably worst disgusting hate filed commentators  on the air gone. It‚Äôs a great day for journalism to see both these fear mongers gone.

15620 This is just to get more money.  Remember, if you don't want to get drafted you pay a fee (~$3500).  Previously, they couldn't get the fee since they had to serve the draft summons in person and those that had enough for the fees could skip town for a few weeks.  Now, they will be able to serve these summons electronically to get their money.  The poor, just like before, are unaffected and will be the ones going to the front lines.

It should not surprise anyone one bit that content released from this war is possibly doctored or published with misleading titles for purposes relating to propoganda. What bothers me is how quickly folks will gobble it up without asking questions or reanalyzing the footage, and when said footage is proven to not be what it is presented as, you get bombarded with dislikes, negative comments, and/or flat-out silenced (i.e. bans). 

My advice is to approach every piece of content you see, especially from this conflict, with skepticism. Ask questions, reanalyze, and most importantly, do your own research.

15824 Flashbacks to Sochi, when they were plastering over loose cinder blocks, had four toilets in one open room, lack of door knobs, uncovered manholes, and how they spent ten billion dollars on a short tunnel making it the most expensive road in the world. You could literally have paved the tunnel with pure gold, and it would have been half the cost. Money just disappears there.

PS: buying stolen property doesn‚Äôt transfer ownership, doesn‚Äôt give you any right to that property or even a refund of the purchase price, or part there of, from the legal owner.

15851 I‚Äôve said it before but, divorcing the grim implications of these new structures, this format is something the U.S. should borrow from to relieve some of the pressure of the housing crisis. These blocks of flats are utilitarian but they work well to house a lot of people for relatively cheap.

During my years living in Moscow and Kiev, I lived in probably six different blocks. They‚Äôre really quiet due to the concrete and can be quite cozy. In 2013 I was even thinking of buying a flat in Moscow, they were only about $60k outside the center. Wish mid sized U.S. cities had options like that. Only overpriced houses and condos for sale.

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
16179 Casualties normally includes both deaths and wounding severe enough to require hospitalization. The figure of 180k for Russian armed forces casualties includes both.

A comparable figure for US armed forces in Vietnam wouldn't be just the 58k deaths, but 211k (including 153k WIA). Soviet official figures for Afghanistan casualties were 14k deaths and 54k wounded, so 68k casualties in total.

It looked to me like the captions said a friendly soldier further out was above ground to throw a grenade and got shot by tihiy?

News Updates. A detailed daily update of the war ‚Äì a daily review ‚Äì is provided by Euromaidan Press. And, of course, there is the always comprehensive daily report by the Institute for the Study of War.

Situation Maps. War in Ukraine by Scribble Maps. The Institute for the Study of War presents a map that depicts the assessed control of terrain in Ukraine as of March 6, 2023, 3:00 PM ET. View more Ukraine SITMAPs that provide updates on the disposition of Russian forces.

Fight for Bakhmut and Stalingrad. Gaelan Hanlon provides an analysis of the Battle of Bakhmut. He used the historical example of the Battle for Stalingrad during World War II as a comparison model. His analysis concludes that the time has come for the Ukrainians to cede control of this small industrial city in eastern Ukraine to the Russians. The defenders should withdraw and live to fight another day. ‚ÄúHow Long Should Ukrainian Forces Defend Bakhmut? Lessons from Stalingrad‚Äù, Modern War Institute, April 18, 2023.

‚ÄúA Wall of Armor‚Äù. The Russian invasion and occupation of Ukraine has galvanized NATO countries into action. Eastern European countries are learning from the conflict in Ukraine that main battle tanks still have a role in a ground war. Part of the response to Russian aggression is sending tanks to Ukraine. This then requires the acquisition of new tanks. Many nations are looking to acquire the M1 Abrams, a U.S. made main battle tank. ‚ÄúThe M1 Abrams is becoming the Benchmark Main Battle Tank for Eastern Europe‚Äù, Real Clear Defense, April 18, 2023.

‚ÄòGun Trucks‚Äô for Ukraine. In an effort to counter the wide-spread use of drones by the Russians the U.S. will soon be providing an inexpensive counter-air solution to Ukraine. 30mm guns that can be mounted on the back of trucks will be sent to the country in the coming months. Kind of like the technicals found in smaller countries ‚Äì big guns on pickup trucks; but better. ‚ÄúUS providing Ukraine with 30mm gun trucks to blast Iranian drones out of the sky‚Äù, Task & Purpose, April 5, 2023.

Fight for the Skies

More Airpower Needed. Douglas Birkey of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies argues that Kyiv needs more jets ‚Äì and points to the recently leaked U.S. intelligence documents to buttress his argument. Ukraine‚Äôs stockpile of surface-to-air missiles are running low and Russia could be on the verge of gaining air superiority later this spring. This would be a disaster for Ukraine‚Äôs planned counteroffensive that may kick off in a matter of weeks. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to lose Ukraine? Empower Kyiv with airpower‚Äù, Breaking Defense, April 17, 2023.

Finland‚Äôs Airspace. The skies of Finland are now open for NATO surveillance and intelligence missions. This will allow NATO to monitor Russian activities more closely in the region. The first surveillance flight was conducted on March 23, 2023. Both manned and unmanned aircraft will be performing these future intelligence gathering missions. Both Sweden and Finland joined NATO‚Äôs Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) program in February 2023. Finland, currently a ‚ÄòNATO partner‚Äô, has applied to join NATO in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and other aggressive activities in the region. ‚ÄúFinland opens airspace for NATO surveillance and intelligence flights‚Äù, Defence Today, March 23, 2023.

Maritime Activities

Blockade of Crimea? Ukraine seems determined, if you listen to the rhetoric, to recapture Crimea from Russia. The peninsula was annexed in 2014 at the beginning of the Russian Ukraine War. Most military analysts believe that Ukraine does not have the military capability to retake Crimea. However, some suggest a Ukrainian blockade is feasible. The peninsular is susceptible to a blockade. It‚Äôs two main supply routes are over the Crimea Bridge that spans the Kerch Strait or on the land route from the Russian border, along the west coast of the Sea of Azov (close to the front lines), and across the narrow band of land that connects Crimea to Ukraine.

TS Docs on Social Media. It appears that Top Secret Pentagon documents with details about the war in Ukraine have been published on some social media sites (Telegram and Twitter). The Pentagon is reviewing the matter but has not provided many details. The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the leaks. The documents include maps of Ukraine, where troops are concentrated, and the kinds of weapons available to the Ukrainian forces. Defense analysts are picking apart the posted documents determining what is real and what is fiction. ‚ÄúTop-secret Pentagon documents on Ukraine war appear on social media‚Äù, NPR, April 7, 2023.

UK SOF in Ukraine? According to some leaked U.S. intelligence documents the United Kingdom has UK special forces operating in Ukraine. One document indicates that as many as 50 UK SOF personnel had been deployed to Ukraine alongside SOF from other nations. The UK Ministry of Defence is pushing back on the claims saying:

‚ÄúThe widely reported leak of alleged classified US information has demonstrated a serious level of accuracy.

But it seems that U.S. intervention has swayed the country to instead provide 152mm and 155mm artillery ammunition to Ukraine instead. Initial plans had Egypt providing up to 40,000 122mm Sakr-45 rockets to Russia. ‚ÄúEgypt nearly supplied rockets to Russia, agreed to arm Ukraine instead, leak shows‚Äù, The Washington Post, April 17, 2023.

16230 Russia unveils secretive weapon to target SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink in Ukraine 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
16231 https://archive.is/l0opl

Russia‚Äôs quest to sabotage Ukrainian forces‚Äô internet access by targeting the Starlink satellite operations that billionaire Elon Musk has provided to Kyiv since the war‚Äôs earliest days appears to be more advanced than previously known, according to a classified U.S. intelligence report obtained by The Washington Post.
Moscow has experimented for months with its Tobol electronic warfare systems in a bid to disrupt Starlink‚Äôs transmissions in Ukraine, the top-secret assessment, which has not been previously disclosed, contends.
The document, among a cache of sensitive materials leaked online through the messaging platform Discord, dates to March and does not indicate whether any of Russia‚Äôs tests have been successful. But the intelligence finding is striking nonetheless as it appears to affirm what observers had only hypothesized previously: that a program ostensibly designed to protect the Kremlin‚Äôs satellites can be employed instead to attack those used by its adversaries.
SpaceX, the firm that owns Starlink, declined to comment. Last spring, Musk briefly addressed the Kremlin‚Äôs attempts to target the technology, writing on Twitter in May that while Starlink had demonstrated its resilience against such ‚Äújamming & hacking‚Äù attempts, the Russians appeared to be intensifying their efforts.
The Pentagon did not address questions about the leaked assessment. ‚ÄúThese systems constitute an important layer in Ukraine‚Äôs communications network,‚Äù said Maj. Charlie Dietz, a Defense Department spokesperson. The department‚Äôs focus, he added, ‚Äúremains on getting the Ukrainians the satellite capabilities they need.‚Äù
Kostiantyn Zhura, a spokesman for the Ukrainian defense ministry, said that officials in Kyiv are aware of Russia‚Äôs efforts and ‚Äútaking measures to neutralize them.‚Äù The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
Starlink has proved vital to Ukraine‚Äôs military, which relies on the small portable terminals to communicate across the battlefield and relay intelligence. Russian forces have had success disabling the Ukrainians‚Äô ability to use other communications equipment, including radios and cellphones, but the satellite signals are harder to disrupt.

Last fall, Musk faced backlash from Ukrainian leaders after putting forward a plan to end the war that critics deemed overly favorable to Russia. Weeks later, the business mogul was criticized again when he threatened to halt funding for the emergency Starlink service. The blowback caused him to quickly reverse course.
It is unclear if Starlink outages that have been reported in Ukraine were the result of Russia‚Äôs Tobol experiments or other jamming capabilities used by Russian forces, such as the truck-mounted Tirada-2 system. Ukrainian troops reported having experienced disruptions in October, as they moved toward Russian positions during successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Ukrainian officials suggested at that time that SpaceX had restricted internet access in those areas to prevent the Russians from using the service, according to a report in the Financial Times.
Analysts have identified at least seven Tobol complexes in Russia, all of which are located next to facilities used to track satellites, according to a report released this month by Secure World Foundation, a privately funded group focused on space security and sustainability. Some of the sites are headquarters for mobile jammers, analysts said.

Satellite interference can happen in two places: in space, by targeting the satellites directly, and on the ground, where weapons can target receivers, according to the Secure World Foundation. The interference that happens in space, what‚Äôs known as uplink jamming, blends a signal with the original broadcast, which distorts the information all users of that satellite receive. Tobol almost certainly works in this way, according to Bart Hendrickx, a researcher who has followed the program closely.
The ground-based method, known as downlink jamming, transmits a signal on the same frequency as the satellite, which prevents connected devices from receiving the legitimate signal. That method has a smaller area of effect because it depends on a jammer getting relatively closer to systems it intends to disrupt.
The leaked document describes ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs ongoing military operational experiment to target the Starlink satellite communications system over Ukraine with Russia‚Äôs Tobol-1‚Äù and identifies three locations within Russia where the tests were conducted. The ‚Äúestimated center‚Äù of where they were directed, near Bakhmut in Ukraine‚Äôs eastern Donetsk region, has seen the war‚Äôs heaviest fighting so far this year.

The experiment, launched in late September, was meant to last 25 days, the U.S. intelligence assessment says, but more than five months had elapsed since the start of the tests and when the leaked document was prepared for senior U.S. officials. The briefing slide does not say why the experiment had gone on so long, if Russia had encountered any problems, or whether the operation had had its intended effect.
Although Russia‚Äôs positioning of Tobol complexes across the country could suggest they are being used for defensive purposes, the three sites disclosed in the U.S. intelligence assessment ‚Äî one outside Moscow, a site near Crimea and another in the western Russian exclave of Kaliningrad ‚Äî are the closest facilities to Ukraine, making them suitable for an offensive operation. Their coverage area seems to envelop all of Ukraine, said Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation.
‚ÄúThe public documentation that we have talks about it being a defensive system, in that Tobol would be used to detect somebody else trying to jam or interfere with Russian satellites. It would analyze those interfering signals, and then broadcast a counter-signal that would try to negate the interference,‚Äù Weeden said.
‚ÄúBut if you can do that,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúyou can probably use those same capabilities to offensively interfere with somebody else‚Äôs satellite.‚Äù
There are only faint hints and disclosures publicly available about the Tobol program, referred to in Russian documents as 14Ts227, and its capabilities has been a mystery for years. Researchers said the program appears to have started about a decade ago.
Hendrickx, a Belgium-based amateur researcher whose uncovering of Russian procurement and court documents has yielded most of the limited public information available about the Tobol program, initially concluded that the system was defensive in nature, according to his 2020 analysis published by the Space Review. But further analysis, underpinned by court documents describing ‚Äúspecialized complexes for the electronic attack of space assets,‚Äù led to fresh revelations and he predicted last year that Tobol can be used offensively.
Starlink satellites pass over the earth low enough such that Tobol is likely able to beam interference signals at them, Hendrickx said in an interview. But challenges remain.
‚ÄúThe problem with Starlink,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis that you have an awful lot of satellites there. It‚Äôs kind of difficult to jam them all, or even a large number.‚Äù Hendrickx acknowledged, though, disrupting even some could help Russian commanders by throwing Ukrainian troops into disarray.

16251 > At least two documents from late February describe a situation in which key elements of Ukraine's defences - Soviet-era SA-11 and SA-10 surface-to-air missiles - are expected to run out by March 31st and May 2nd respectively.

> Given that the two systems combined account for 89% of Ukraine's medium to high range protection, according to the document, these sound like dire predictions.

> The projections are based on what is described as "current interceptor consumption", with the conclusion that Ukraine can only withstand 2-3 more waves of Russian attacks on its civilian infrastructure.

Explains why Russia has been randomly attacking infrastructure - they are depleting air defenses.  Abrams wont matter, tigers wont matter.  Once they have air superiority its basically an "I win" button.   I'd say that is revealing something.

16322 It's impressive that Ukraine accomplished this without a navy. It's likely the largest ship ever sunk by a modern anti ship missle. It's incredible and borders on unbelievable that it only took two missles. Not only was the hit a bulls eye, but it was made possible by sleight of hand using drones to occupy and confuse the Moscva air defenses. 

For reference, in 1988 the US sunk an Iranian frigate that had a displacement of 1100 tons empty. It took 3 harpoon missles, 4 rocket propelled bombs, a TV guided bomb, and several old-fashioned dumb bombs to finish the job.

The Moscva had an empty displacement of 9380 tons.

Vladyslav Ammosov, a former officer of Russia‚Äôs GRU military intelligence service, has defected to Ukraine and is working to establish a Siberian volunteer battalion to fight his former compatriots, Radio Liberty reported on April 10, citing sources in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to Ammosov, he is currently at the final stages of creating a Siberian Battalion volunteer unit. It will be staffed with representatives of different ethnic groups living in Russia who oppose Moscow‚Äôs imperial policies.

In an interview with Radio Liberty, Ammosov said he is ‚Äúready to deploy immediately into Russian territory as a part of a sabotage and reconnaissance group and destroy enemies who support Putin‚Äôs authorities.‚Äù

Vladyslav Ammosov was born in Yakutsk, Siberia. He has spent more than 15 years building a career in Russian armed forces and special services, participating in the second Russian-Chechen war on Moscow‚Äôs side. He says that he "was an imperialist who fell for propaganda," as he joined the military during the first Chechen war, and after graduating from university he chose to become a military officer and decided that "his place is in Chechnya." Ammosov claims that he was taught ‚Äúto destroy entire countries."

He assures that he left the service before Russia occupied Crimea in 2014. Ammosov also says that he went through a rigorous vetting process with Ukrainian security services, after making his intentions known to them immediately after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

16367  **Ukraine‚Äôs defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom says it has shipped another batch of 125 mm tank shells to the country‚Äôs Defense Forces.**

That‚Äôs according to the company[ press service](https://www.facebook.com/ukroboronprom/posts/pfbid02RmgS5P8hJNt4DKMgcNpzz4qkKiiFhTL78ktRk2u6YPi7iYbR4H61bkmNjUXhYwEzl?locale=ru_RU), Ukrinform reports.

"Ammunition is produced abroad, together with one of the NATO allies," the statement reads.

 "We are working further, bringing victory closer together," the concern emphasized.

As reported by Ukrinform, State Concern Ukroboronprom in cooperation with a NATO member state started the [production ](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3682319-ukroboronprom-starts-production-of-125mm-tank-ammunition-abroad.html)of 125mm tank ammunition abroad.

 As noted, this is the second type of ammunition, the production of which the State Concern‚Äôs enterprises have launched in close partnership with a NATO ally. For security reasons, 125mm rounds will be manufactured outside Ukraine.

Earlier, Ukroboronprom signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine for the supply of 120mm mortar rounds which are also manufactured in cooperation with a NATO member state.

Having lost at least 2,000 tanks in its 14-month wider war on Ukraine, and struggling to source the high-tech components its needs to build new tanks, Russia has been pulling out of long-term storage hundreds of 60-year-old T-62s and 70-year-old T-55s. Tanks that were obsolete decades ago.

A 41-ton T-62 with its 115-millimeter smoothbore gun, or a 40-ton T-55 with its 100-millimeter rifled gun, isn‚Äôt just easier for Russian industry to restore than a newer T-90 or T-72 is‚Äîafter all, the T-62 or T-55 requires fewer ball bearings and electronic components. The older tank also is easier for its crew to operate.

That has training implications. "The crews prepare for them \[the T-55s and T-62s\] in a shorter timeframe," Ukrainian commentator Oleksandr Kovalenko said.

The T-55 and T-62 are from a generation of Soviet tanks before the introduction of automatic gun-loaders, sophisticated fire-controls and crew layouts that allow a gunner and commander independently to search for targets.

The upside is that a four-person crew could learn to operate its old tank fast‚Äîas in, after just a few weeks of training. The downside, of course, is that the crew still is riding in an obsolete tank. A T-55 or T-62 is easier to use because it‚Äôs old, crude tech.

Old, crude tech that might not last long in combat‚Äîand which might end up getting new tankers killed faster.

Still, the Russians seem to appreciate the old tanks‚Äô less demanding training requirement. After all, many of those 2,000 tanks they‚Äôve lost in Ukraine took their crews with them when they blew up. It‚Äôs possible thousands of experienced Russian tankers have died in the wider war; replacing them might be as difficult as replacing their tanks is.

Kovalenko noted Russia‚Äôs growing shortage of good tank crews when he tracked a batch of a dozen restored T-72s, T-80s and T-90s reaching a Russian army motorized unit near Svatove in eastern Ukraine. "The most interesting thing is that there are no crews in the unit who can operate these tanks," Kovalenko said.

Assigning new crews to old tanks might seem like a solution to this problem. In reality, it‚Äôs a short-term expedient‚Äîand a self-defeating one, at that.

It‚Äôs possible to upgrade the optics in a T-55 or T-62 by swapping out the 70-year-old TSh 2-22 gunner‚Äôs sight for a 1PN96MT-02 analog sight that, while not as sophisticated as the state-of-the-art Sosna-U digital sight is, at least is new and reliable. It also is possible to boost an older tank‚Äôs protection by bolting reactive armor blocks onto the hull and turret.

But there‚Äôs very little Russian industry can do to improve a T-55 or T-62‚Äôs main gun, internal layout or turret-hull integration. And all are problematic.

‚ÄúThe T-62's most significant weakness is its slow rate of fire,‚Äù the U.S. Army explained in a 1979 bulletin. Where the crew of a Ukrainian T-64, Leopard 2 or M-1 can fire 10 or even 12 rounds a minute, a T-55 or T-62 crew might manage three or four rounds a minute.

The reasons are myriad. ‚ÄúThe ammunition is inconveniently stored for rapid loading,‚Äù according to the U.S. Army bulletin. ‚ÄúUnder certain conditions, the gun must be elevated before the loader can place a new round in the breech. The automatic ejection system requires six seconds to complete a cycle.‚Äù

While the T-55 and T-62 suffer other limitations‚Äîslow turret-traverse mechanisms, for instance‚Äîthe lethargic rate of fire is one constraint that‚Äôs bound to get a lot of Russian tankers killed in direct clashes with the Ukrainians.

During the pivotal battle around Chernihiv in north-central Ukraine in the spring of 2022, the Ukrainian 1st Tank Brigade hid its T-64s in the forests around the city. When Russian tanks rolled past, the T-64 crews opened fire.

‚ÄúBetter crew training combined with short-ranged engagements where their armament was competitive, and the faster autoloader on the T-64, allowed Ukrainian tank crews to achieve significant damage against surprised Russian units,‚Äù analysts Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi, Jack Watling, Oleksandr Danylyuk and Nick Reynolds explained in a study for the Royal United Services Institute in London.

As T-55s and T-62s replace T-72s in Russian formations, the Ukrainians‚Äô gunnery advantage only will grow.

But comparing an old Russian tank to a newer Ukrainian tank really is missing the point. The Kremlin‚Äôs tank-crew crisis is a reminder that, in warfare, people matter more than machines do. Rushing new tankers through a short training course in order to squeeze them into old T-55s and T-62s and speed those tanks to the front line might create an impression of Russian strength. But it won‚Äôt win battles.

Because those crews‚Äîtank commanders, or TCs, especially‚Äîwill lack experience. ‚ÄúIt is ... important that deciders in crews and platoons (TCs and platoon leaders) have the necessary experience to allow them to react to rapidly changing future battlefields,‚Äù Billy Burnside noted in a 1979 study for the U.S. Army.

In ‚Äòsolving‚Äô their tanker-shortage by equipping crews with obsolete tanks, the Russians might end up creating an even deeper tanker shortage‚Äîby getting a bunch of four-man T-55 and T-62 crews killed in lopsided fights with better-equipped, better-trained Ukrainian forces.

The governors of two Russian regions bordering Ukraine have decided to cancel military parades on 9 May in order "not to provoke the enemy" by creating clusters of soldiers and equipment.

**Source**: Kremlin-aligned news outlet [RBC](https://t.me/rbc_news/71814?fbclid=IwAR2swrann9NXk37IC0ZNXDmfxvSSgPxJnOcnQHSIzsS2p6Kcbm3S850Wl84), quoting Roman Starovoyt, the governor of Kursk Oblast, and Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod Oblast; Russian Telegram channel [ASTRA](https://t.me/astrapress/24528)

**Details:** It is reported that Kursk will not hold a parade on 9 May "for security reasons".

According to Starovoyt, this is due to the position of the region's operational headquarters, which decided to enhance anti-terrorism measures last week.

The parade in Belgorod was also cancelled.

**Quote from Gladkov:** "I can tell you now that there will be no parade in order not to provoke the enemy with a large number of vehicles and soldiers in the centre of Belgorod."

**More details:** According to the governor, the matter of the salute and the procession of the "Immortal Regiment" \[a Russian custom to honour their fallen soldiers who fought in the WWII, typically observed on 9 May ‚Äì ed.\] will be considered at the next meeting of the operational staff and a decision will be made based on security issues.¬†

# UK Defence Intelligence: Russia strengthens armoured attacks near Marinka

The Russian Federation continues to suffer considerable losses on the Donetsk front, in particular near Marinka and Avdiivka, to no avail.¬†

**Source:** This was revealed in the latest [intelligence update](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1645302368945201152) by the UK Ministry of Defence, reports [European Pravda](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2023/04/10/7159475/)

As stated in the report, over the last seven days, Russia has likely increased its armoured assaults around the Donetsk Oblast town of Mariinka, 20 kilometres south-west of the city of Donetsk.¬†

Mariinka has been fought over since 2014 and has been largely destroyed by artillery exchanges. It commands the approaches to Donetsk and the key H15 road.

"Russia continues to give a high priority to resourcing operations in the broader Donetsk sector, including the Mariinka and Avdiivka areas, expending significant resources for minimal gains," says the report.

At the end of March, British intelligence reported that Russian forces [were suffering significant losses](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/03/28/7395358/) in vehicles while trying to encircle Avdiivka and were not making any significant progress there.

On Saturday, Ukrainian and Russian sources noted a slowdown in the pace of Russian offensive operations along the entire front, the American think tank [**Institute for War Studies (ISW) writes**](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1644863163723120641) in its latest report.¬†According to analysts, this is proof that the Russian offensive is ‚Äúapproaching its climax‚Äù.¬†As the ISW points out, the Russian military is compensating for the marked decline in the offensive capabilities of its infantry with the increased use of artillery on key sections of the front.

On April 8, Ivan Tymochko, head of the Reservists Council of the Land Forces of Ukraine, announced that Russian forces were fighting along the entire front, but¬†‚Äúthe offensive potential of Putin‚Äôs army is decreasing‚Äù¬†.¬†He stated that the Russians ‚Äúare not making serious progress anywhere on the front.‚Äù¬†He noted that the intensity of the assaults in and around Bakhmut itself had slightly decreased, but there were no changes in the front line in other directions.¬†He also pointed out that¬†the offensive against Avdiivka had ‚Äústuck‚Äù, while Marjinka, despite being reduced to a heap of rubble, was still not controlled by Putin‚Äôs military.

The Institute of Internal Affairs points out that the Ukrainian observations are confirmed by Russian military bloggers.¬†‚ÄúIn the Russian information space, Russian offensive capabilities are no longer discussed, but Ukraine‚Äôs potential to regain a large part of its territory is assessed,‚Äù¬†reads the ISW report.

In addition, ISW analysts point to another factor: the way the Russians use artillery indicates that Putin‚Äôs army wants to use it to balance its degraded offensive capabilities.

Analysts note that due to the shortage of artillery ammunition, the Russian command is sending new missile shipments as a priority only to those sections of the front where offensive operations are being carried out.

‚ÄúThe high demand for missiles indicates that the Russian military still relies heavily on artillery to offset key combat capability deficiencies, including the Russians‚Äô poor aiming skills and inadequate air support. Putin‚Äôs army continues to pre-empt assaults with heavy artillery fire, which reduce entire cities to rubble to facilitate the task of infantry poorly prepared for combat, and to reduce the need to use aviation, which is exposed to being shot down during bombings‚Äù¬†‚Äì explains the ISW.

16497 Summary of overnight:

Russia resumed regular massive rocket attacks on Ukraine before the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

For the second time in a week, Russia launched a massive missile attack on Ukrainian regions far from the front. Regular shelling resumed ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Details. On Monday night, 18 X-101/X-555 cruise missiles were fired across Ukraine, 15 of them were shot down, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Kyiv administration reported that air defense forces shot down all Russian missiles and drones over the capital of Ukraine at night.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Odessa regional administration reported that Russian missiles were sent to eight Ukrainian regions: Dnepropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, Kiev, Sumy, Poltava, Zaporozhye and Cherkasy regions.

On Sunday evening, explosions occurred in Pavlograd in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The head of the regional administration, Sergei Lysak, said that 25 people, including three children, were injured as a result of the strike. He added that an industrial enterprise was damaged, as well as high-rise buildings and private houses.

‚ñ™Ô∏èPro-Russian channels, including the Komsomolskaya Pravda military commander Alexander Kots and Readovka, claim that an explosion occurred at the railway junction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Pavlograd. The Rybar channel writes that Geran-2 drones were launched in the city - this is how the Iranian Shahed 136 drones are called in the Russian army, as well as tactical aviation missiles. On Russian TV channels, they said that in Pavlograd "the Armed Forces of Ukraine were methodically pulling together air defense systems for a counteroffensive."

Context. Prior to the shelling of Ukrainian cities on April 28, there had been no massive cruise missile strikes since the beginning of March.

‚ñ™Ô∏èIn recent days, Ukrainian officials have been regularly talking about the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a counteroffensive. Last week, Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said that the troops were waiting for the decision of the command to launch an offensive: ‚ÄúWe received very modern weapons <‚Ä¶> As soon as God‚Äôs will, the weather and the decision of the commanders, we will do it.‚Äù Christopher Cavoli, Commander-in-Chief of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe, said on Thursday that the allies had transferred more than 98% of the promised combat vehicles to Ukraine.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Armed Forces of Ukraine also began to attack Russian targets in preparation for the offensive. It was the preparation for the future operation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine that explained the drone strike on the oil depot in Sevastopol.

Update on the Russian attack on Pavlohrad above from a reliable OSINT twitter account.

Fortunately, from new video angles, it seems like the chemical plant storing old/decommissioned SS-24 boosters was hit and not the railway station.

Therefore, the initial Russian claims that multiple S-300 launchers and ammunition (being transported for the counter-offensive) were destroyed near the railway station look to be false.

Ukraine still needs to be super careful when transporting and storing missiles though. In my opinion, it is far better to be logistically slower and transport ammunition and launchers separately and slowly to different locations rather than transport quickly and to one place. Especially when neither side has air supremacy.

16501 >In parallel with a battle for Bakhmut, which has turned into the epicenter of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, intense fighting continues around the city, where the "Wagner" PMC are also trying to advance. One of the hottest is the Soledar direction. However, the successes of the Russian forces here are much more modest than in the city itself. The positions on this part of the front are jointly held by border guards, servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense. The results of their work are eloquently evidenced by the nearby fields littered with the bodies of the slain occupiers. Artillery shelling, shooting battles and "meat" assaults of "Wagner" - this is what the everyday life of DPSU servicemen looks like, which you can see in the video material.

16518 Just consider that these are only the ones that have been *identified* - there are plenty more that are still unknown –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–∞ (‚ÄúIvan Ivanovich‚Äù being the Russian equivalent of ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù - a placeholder name) that haven‚Äôt been able to be traced, and even more bodies that have been so badly disfigured and mutilated that they cannot be identified.

The amount of casualties they are sustaining is staggering - nearly a quarter of a million so far. And yes, while the term ‚Äúcasualty‚Äù refers to both death and injury that takes a soldier out of action, it is still jaw-dropping either way. Keep in mind, the Soviet-Afghan war had some 70-80,000 casualties, but that conflict lasted over 9 years - Russia has had 2.5-3 times that amount in only a little over a year. 

It just goes to show how Russia‚Äôs military doctrine has been written around fighting far smaller, less well-equipped, and poorly organized insurgency forces for the past 30+ years; when they‚Äôre no longer fighting loose cells of the Mujahideen and are instead fighting a proper military with western training, tactics, and armament, they face devastating casualties. They went in with confidence from years of fighting insurgents and disorganized minor armies, expecting to have a similar time fighting Ukraine, but hadn‚Äôt realized just how much had changed since 2014, and how much stiffer resistance they‚Äôd face trying to conquer an entire country, rather than annexing an already disputed territory.

16520 This is why rushing to conclusions is so dangerous because you get MSM reporting on information that becomes outdated quickly. No, an ammunition depot was not hit. They hit a storage of soviet missiles (with no military value) and 1800 tons of rocket fuel. Russians just wanted to hit a target that made a big boom because they're spiteful over losing their oil depot in Sevastopol.

16539 Ukrainian officials hint at Crimea strike success.

Ukraine does not usually claim responsibility for attacks on Crimea. 

But as we‚Äôve reported today, an apparent drone strike is thought to have started an enormous fire in the region. 

Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram that air defence and electronic warfare forces on Saturday shot down two drones over the region. 

And Ukrainian officials have hinted at a successful strike on Russian targets, while being coy as usual. 

In a daily update on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said units had hit "two depots of fuel and lubricants, two air defence systems, one artillery unit and another important enemy target," but gave no more details, Reuters reported. 

Typically, the Ukrainian military will use euphemistic language ‚Äì or vague descriptions like this ‚Äì after a successful strike in Crimea. 

But a military intelligence official went into a little more detail, according to RBC Ukraine. 

The official, Andriy Yusov, did not say Ukraine was behind the explosion in Sevastopol. 

However, he suggested 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia's Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported. 

Mr Yusov described the blast as "God's punishment" for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. 

"This punishment will be long-lasting," RBC Ukraine quoted him as saying. 

Mr Yusov is said to have added a warning to Crimea‚Äôs residents to help them stay safe from future fighting in the occupied area. 

He said: ‚ÄúIn the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor's army." 

Ukraine says control of all its legal territory, including Crimea, is a key condition for any peace deal.

16540 Short update from Girkin (from Russian point of view):

> Brief summary of the second wartime April: 

> 1) In the last month the battle for Bakhmut has failed to be "excruciatingly won", the enemy continues to defend on the western outskirts, determined to hold out until a counteroffensive on some other (I guess) front. "Wagner" has been bled dry, its assault force (even with constant reinforcement by volunteer units and "mobiks" from the MoD) was not enough to complete the operation in April. The "Bakhmut meat grinder" continues for both sides, but the enemy has achieved their goals, while our side has not. 

> 2) Near Avdiivka, our forces have failed and are now - due to heavy losses - forced to pull back again, leaving some of the positions they had previously occupied. In Maryinka - largely no changes - bloody "tug-of-war" street fighting continued throughout April, with variable success. On the other fronts, there were local battles and exchanges of artillery and air strikes. 

> The overall conclusion is that the April battles were again broadly successful for the enemy (in the context of buying time in strategic defence). In May the summer campaign will start and the "turn for the Ukrainians" will begin, as our generals managed to achieve virtually nothing over the winter and spring except the disposal of the shock troops in the Donbass.

16549 Russian troops shelled the old and central parts of Avdiivka several times. Two high-rise buildings have collapsed. All three floors, to the foundation. 

1,782 people remain in Avdiivka, including a 12-year-old boy - they are looking for him. https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2023/04/30/7400067/

16607 [Previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12z5soj/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jhua3lq/)

Day 428-430 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 3 days were mostly quiet here in the city, there were no missiles fired in our direction, but a new comparatively ‚Äúbig‚Äù missile strike did sadly happen. Although it can hardly be called big when they only fired around 23-25 missiles, which is almost nothing when compared to the strikes where they were using 60-100 missiles.

Those fucking bastards still continue to specifically target civilians. They hit residential buildings in multiple regions and they did it at night too, which is the time when they would inflict the greatest number of casualties because most people would be asleep in their homes. The situation in Uman is just horrific, they killed 23 people, including 6 children, and for fucking what? What the fuck did that achieve?

They also killed a child and her mother in Dnipro where they targeted a private house. And then their MOD goes and fucking posts ‚ÄúRight on target‚Äù after killing 7 children in 1 missile strike. I don‚Äôt even know what to say, they are just barbaric monsters. Today their news channels also stole the video of that woman from Uman that survived their missile strike to say that ‚ÄúUkrainians are bombing Donetsk‚Äù. Every time you think that Russians can‚Äôt go any lower, somehow, they always manage to reach a new low.

I assume this is in return for the technical support and helicopter parts and spare engines that Ukraine is providing.

This would follow the trend as Pakistan has traded weapons and ammo with Ukraine in exchange for Ukrainian support for Soviet/Russian origin systems in Pakistan.

A Russian missile went astray and flew into Poland and landed in a forest near Bydgoszcz back in December 

Mind you, this city is past Warsaw. Which means this missile literally flew half way into Poland

On one occasion, his platoon of 40 was commanded to go forward being a ‚Äúshock hammer‚Äù against the Russians.

> *ten guys died, four were captured. Seven people got out on their feet, the rest were wounded.*

That‚Äôs 7 of the 40... just for that one attack. 

He says that he was collecting collecting collecting bodies.  But that UA command knows what that does to the psyche to have to collect so many brothers, that he was sent on leave.  

But this is what I found interesting/new‚Äîand it‚Äôs not written in detail, just a side note... well, he tells various attacks he did, all have a lot of death. But that the hardest part‚Äîafter the family of the fallen soldier is informed, that they want to speak with his brothers, to learn how it happened.  So, apparently, even now this is hard for him, thinking about the calls and the conversations telling the families how their son/husband died.  Allows sense of closure, and likely pride and understanding and finality.  I guess I didn‚Äôt know they did this...  Id think only chaplains or officers could, bc surely, it would be tough on someone.

16646 The Danish Armed Forces have confirmed that a Danish patrol boat captured 26 photos of the Russian vessel in the area east of Bornholm Island on 22 September 2022. The Russian ship is designed for underwater operations and has an AS-26 Priz mini-submarine on board.  
Earlier, it was reported that the Danish Ministry of Defence had obtained 112 images of Russian vessels in the area. This is the first time the ministry has confirmed that the ship was an SS-750 with a mini-submarine on board. The Danish Defence Ministry refuses to share the photos of the Russian special vessel, as these are "intelligence" images and are involved in "intelligence operations".

> Russia hurled missiles at cities across Ukraine as people slept early on Friday, killing at least 12 people in the first large-scale air strikes in nearly two months.

> Beginning late last year Russia launched such attacks roughly weekly, though they had tapered off as winter ended, with Western countries saying Moscow had used up much of its long range missile arsenal in a failed bid to freeze Ukrainian cities.

> Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians, but its air strikes and shelling have killed thousands of people and devastated cities and towns across Ukraine.

16672 Ukrainian air defence was largely successful, destroying 21 out of 23 missiles and 2 UAVs.   

6 people were killed in the attack, including a mother and her 3-year-old daughter in Dnipro.

A tragedy. Nearly 100% of missiles were destroyed, unfortunately the other 2 ended up having awful consequences.

Once again however, I think we see a lack of missiles, even a few months ago we‚Äôd see of upwards 50+ in these terrorist strikes Russia does. A drop to 23. 

Rest in peace to those who had their lives cut short by these sadistic maniacs.

One of the channels^1 had reported that the Russians had reached the *Bakhmut Industrial Vocation College* campus which is deep in the West side of town, on Tchaikovsky, specifically, [it is here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bakhmut¬∑s πkyy+Industrial πnyy+Fakhovyy+Koledzh/@48.5840488,37.969899,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x40dfe62b85222725:0x79d1eac68ada8590!8m2!3d48.5840487!4d37.971692!16s%2Fg%2F1hd_83gqd?hl=en-us).

Around that same time, Kholodny Yar, 93rd Mechanized Brigade published a video attacking Russians.  Soon afterwards, a second UA channel^2 geolocates it, and I recognize that spot‚Äîthe UA has *just* attacked the *Bakhmut Industrial Vocation College*, presumably to kill the Russians, but also maybe to flatten so they don‚Äôt have a vantage point.

16681 I've spent a day trying to create a map of military vehicles in and around Mariupol.  


You can view it here: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Imu8PP\_ZnIoRrYuBWXxzDVBcM0RyL8s&usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Imu8PP_ZnIoRrYuBWXxzDVBcM0RyL8s&usp=sharing)  


Please note that I'm nowhere near an 'expert in osint', so all of the names (BTR/BMP, etc), as well as whether they are really russian or not is just an assumption.  


And to my surprise, it is really not a lot of them, like just about 5-6 artillery units (each with 3-4 guns), and probably less than 50 APC/IFVs, almost no tanks.  


The map of territorial control on the supposed date of satellite images (26 march 2022) is approximate, the source was liveuamap ([https://liveuamap.com/en/2022/27-march-a-column-of-russian-t72b3-tanks-operating-in-mariupol](https://liveuamap.com/en/2022/27-march-a-column-of-russian-t72b3-tanks-operating-in-mariupol))  


Feel free to suggest other interesting things I may have missed, but let's avoid discussions such as "it's not a BTR, it's a BMP".  


Also added some destroyed military vehicles I've noticed around Kyiv.  


I have also created (way back) a map of trenches around Donbass area, you can view it here

16683 Russians brag that their Zala 421 reconnaissance drone is ‚Äúinvisible.‚Äù  [Despite this, Ukrainian Guardsman shot one down, Kherson region.](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/04/28/7399918/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui)  It landed in a still-mined area.  After a day to determine concretely whether that area is in firing-range of the Russians on the other shore [it wasnt], Ukraine demined the path and went to pick it up.  They are now studying it, they want to ensure it won‚Äôt be ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to them.

16687 Ukrainian milblogger Bogdan Myroshnykov posted this today, on Bakhmut: 

*Afternoon:*

> Bakhmut - heavy fighting in the city. 

> The enemy makes progress towards the western districts. 

> On the flanks [khromove, Ivanivske], possible so far to control the situation. 

*Evening:*

Bakhmut 

> All that can be said now is that ours are holding on. 

> The enemy dismantles the buildings in the western quarters,^1 thus, the stability of our defense deteriorates somewhat. 

> On the flanks in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIvanivske and Khromove‚Äîit‚Äôs hell. 

*Late Night:*

> Bakhmut 

> Heavy fighting continues, and the general situation is close to critical. 

> The enemy gradually advances towards the western quarters, and high-rise buildings are being "dismantled" by [their] artillery and aviation.^1

> We continue to lose the private sector [residential neighborhoods] in the western regions, due to the frenzied pressure of the enemy and its superiority in personnel [Russia flooding with overwhelming numbers of soldiers].

> The track near Khromove remains under the control of the Defense Forces. As well as Khromove itself, as well as Bohdanivka and Ivanovske. 

> But the "way of life"^2 is now the most difficult sector of defense on all fronts. The enemy had already entered the track several times, but then was knocked out of it. Basically, the situation seems to be under control, albeit with huge, ongoing problems. 

> The defense of Bakhmut continues to restrain the enemy's significant forces, preventing them from deploying [further] to attack Siversk, Chasiv Yar, and Kostyantynivka. 

> Every day the situation of our Bakhmut garrison worsens. How long it will be possible to keep the remains of the city‚Äînone of us knows. 

> Challenging days lie ahead for the Defense Forces . [he then asks for donations towards Ukraine, including specific units].

‚Äîone particularly painful loss to citizens following the news was yesterday‚Äôs [demolition of Bakhmut‚Äôs iconic muralled buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/130987c/comment/jhzu0wy/)
 at the entrance of the city.  [though they support AFU and vow to one day rebuild...]  Today, one building decimated that a UA channel showed drone footage didn‚Äôt look like UA‚Äôs previous building demos. ***Here:*** https://t\.me/Bakhmut_2022/20299  Which is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/pbpeYC92AoJaT6su9).
Given how it looks like a different type of demolishment than what UA employs‚Äîand now Myroshnykov saying the Russians are doing it, too, then this building was very likely done by them.
 However, is in a western district street RF already seized‚Äîwhy *RF* decimates a building on street *RF* already took, it means lines are more fluid right there that had realized, or it means RF is retreating, or that its part of a torched-earth campaign.

^2  Term for the transport route.  Previously, that was the T0504 to Ivanivske, aka the Bakhmut-Kostianivka Highway;  however, I think here he‚Äôs talking about the O0506 that runs up through Khromove.

16699 Russia hits Ukraine with deadly missile salvo, killing at least 16 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
16700 Here's a preview of the story: 

Russia fired a barrage of more than 20 cruise missiles and two explosive drones at Ukraine early Friday, killing at least 16 people according to Ukrainian officials. The deadliest strike was at least one missile that tore into an apartment building in the central city of Uman, bringing death and destruction hundreds of miles from any active front line.

At least 14 people were killed in that strike alone, according to Ukraine's interior minister, including two 10-year-old children. The missile tore off one end of the residential building as families slept.

"We're covered in blood," wailed a young mother in a video she posted on social media. "The children were sleeping here‚Ä¶ it's good that everyone's alive."

As she pointed her camera at a burning crater outside their building, she swore at the Russians responsible for the attack.

It was a terrifying glimpse at the reality of life in Ukraine: Nowhere is completely safe amid the threat of Russian missiles raining down indiscriminately on towns and cities, killing civilians in their sleep.

16705 ‚ÄúTheir patrols into the Atlantic and throughout the Atlantic are at a high level most of the time, at a higher level than we‚Äôve seen in years,‚Äù Cavoli testified before the House Armed Services Committee. ‚ÄúAnd this, despite all the efforts they‚Äôre undertaking in Ukraine.‚Äù

Cavoli‚Äôs assessment represents **a grave warning for future threats Russia may pose to the U.S.** and Ukraine‚Äôs other western backers.

Though analysts have expressed concerns about Russia‚Äôs submarine forces in recent weeks, they have largely centered on the recent attention the Kremlin has focused on its Pacific Fleet, which conducted massive drills last week and which Moscow analyzed and claimed last week has ‚Äúhigh readiness.‚Äù Those maneuvers were seen in part as an acknowledgement of Moscow and Beijing‚Äôs increased partnership.

16739 Pro-Russian telegram channels announced the firing of Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail "Butcher of Mariupol" Mizintsev. 
> 
> Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense in charge of Logistics Mikhail Mizintsev was dismissed from his post. This was reported by the pro-Russian Rybar telegram channel without indicating sources.
> 
> The resignation of Mizintsev was also announced by "military correspondent" Alexander Sladkov. He expressed the opinion that other resignations should be expected in the Ministry of Defense in the near future, since "there is an untimely escalation of the struggle within the power bloc."
> 
> According to Sladkov, Alexei Kuzmenkov, who until recently was the deputy head of the Rosgvardiya, has been appointed the new deputy defense minister for logistics.
> 
> Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on reports of Mizintsev's resignation. ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt say anything about this. This is a question for the Ministry of Defense,‚Äù he said.
> 
> Mizintsev was appointed the post of Deputy Minister of Defense for Logistics in September of 2022. Prior to that, he served as head of the National Defense Center of the Russian Federation.
> 
> According to the Ukrainian military, Mizintsev personally commanded the siege of Mariupol, during which the city was almost completely destroyed, in connection with which in Ukraine and in the West they began to call him "the butcher of Mariupol." Officially, the Russian Federation did not confirm Mizintsev's participation in the capture of the city, some independent experts also doubted that he was responsible for the destruction of Mariupol.

16748 Does anyone know when were the updated satellite images over Mariupol taken? I could only find something like 26 march 2022, but not sure this is accurate.

I'm trying to create a map of military vehicles in and around Mariupol, but can barely find anything (not even 50 BTRs, for example), which doesn't make sense if the date of the images is really 26 march 2022 - which was right about time when russians were storming Mariupol.

16750 Ukraine has *several* [underwater drones](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/04/27/7399754/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui)

> One of the torpedo prototypes has already been presented at the Brave1 exhibition (defense tech development support coalition in Ukraine). The range of this underwater drone is 2,000 kilometers. In case of jamming, the device identifies the jamming zone. It can be in standby mode for up to 3 months. It automatically scans the area with a 3D sonar, hydrophone, and camera. Such scanning will help to make mine maps for demining.


> The guidance system uses GPS, or works with the help of an inertial navigation system in the absence of GPS (underwater), or during signal jamming. It identifies targets using video cameras and thermal imaging cameras and visually using a neural network. The guidance system includes passive sonar‚Äîidentification and bearing of underwater and surface objects using a hydrophone system. Ultrasonic sonars (active sonar) at close range are also included. Orientation and identification by size of objects.

> In total, three versions are being developed: TLK 1000 (4-12 meters long); TLK 400 (4-6 meters); TLK 150 (2.5 meters long).  The TLK 150 will be equipped with an electric motor, have a range of 100 km and the ability to carry up to 20-50 kg of explosives. TLK 400 will receive 500 kg of explosives and a range of 1,200 kilometers. The 4-12-meter TLK 1000 with a range of 2,000 kilometers will be able to carry up to 5,000 kg of explosives

16752 Normally, when a high profile person like a General is said to ‚Äúvisit the front,‚Äù they don‚Äôt mean *literally* the front.  Like Gen Syrky or Zelensky visiting Bakhmut, it means ‚ÄúHQ for Bakhmut‚Äù... which is Kostiantinivka...

Brigadier General Viktor Horenko, who commands the Special Operations Forces (SSO), actually went *in* to Bakhmut, on his recent trip. 
 
[**video**](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2023/04/27/7399609/), driving in to hell

SSO statement on why he took this extraordinary risk:  General Khorenko visited the actual positions of his fighters in order to assess the situation with his own eyes.

(I cant understand the first guy, the second guy is telling route they will take, which is why some audio is missing.  The later video is via night vision.)

16754 # Bakhmut


The soldiers and milbloggers all have difficult, negative news today.  It‚Äôs tough. A second channel now also reports the extreme distance west that Russians have reached [this far](https://goo.gl/maps/WZuW4b2PaFkc88t59). Some channels had redundant info, others didn‚Äôt publish. 
Here are portions from three, with a fourth in footnotes:


[I]

@bahshid2023

> There is an battle for Khromove; our positions are completely stormed by attacks 8-10 times per day. In places to the north, we also go on assaults. While the Russians aren‚Äôt surrounding us, they still have an advantage with weapons and aviation. 

[II]

@krvchkwar confirmed the Russians reached Tchaikovsky, and included map.^^1,2 **See the map here:**
https://t\.me/krvchkwar/12341

[III]

The @peredovich0k channel had a lengthy update.  It‚Äôs so long I‚Äôm just gonna use google translation: 



> The northern side - the situation is quite difficult, because the enemy pressed at night, during the day and is still pressing on  Tolbukhina, Levchenko, Victory streets; the assault does not stop for a minute, the meat is scorched and scorched, that's why many positions were left by the boys and that is a very good decision. Aligning the front line is very difficult for Russians, so they stick forward between everything. 

> The central part - the situation is actually shit, because the enemy is pressing without even wanting to slow down, the intensity of line changes is simply crazy, then they moved forward a little, then back and so on around the clock, but we are simply being bombarded with meat, which even I don't think is very good, who understands where we got to at this stage. Polyova street came under the full control of the Russians at night, the defense is partial on Pushkina street, but the boys will be taken out from there, maintenance is not realistic in that area. 

> The southern part - the situation is not better here, because the enemy's advance is significant, it means gaining partial control over some streets, after joining the two lines, the enemy pushed forward, after which they gained control over several streets in that part. 

> The Khromove track is a fierce battle, the guys are on the defensive, there were about 10+ attempts to advance during the night, well, nothing yet. 

> Conclusion: as I said, the enemy accumulated a lot of forces while conducting combat reconnaissance (about two weeks ago) when there were almost no changes in the territory, but there were many counterattacks from our side, the guys were incited, from Syria and Africa (this is about the PKV) they launched assaults, drove the mobilized to the flanks for containment, and began to simply push us out of the city. 

> I will say more, it seems that no one really wants to surround Bakhmut anymore, because looking around, you understand that there is more hell in the city, so you begin to understand that the desire to surround the city is not so great as to simply push us out of it, because this is exactly what is happening. We are literally being pushed out of town. And looking at the situation, we begin to understand what to do against a pile of meat that storms you from groups of 30-40 people, then there are storming groups that are already training, and what can I say, even prisoners recruited by this private mercenary, who by some miracle are still alive, already know how to fight well, because the best skills come in practice. 

> Somehow, there is no good news yet, but we are not discouraged, yes, it is difficult, but we are carrying out a combat mission, which we are doing very well so far, many understand what I am talking about, and who still does not understand what we are holding , better wait and at one point I will tell you, the task is for Bakhmut.

16756 A Russian-speaking Ukrainian milblogger‚Äîwho‚Äôs reported primarily from occupied areas since 2014‚Äîclaims that there was a surprising incident back on the night of April 21-22.  A team of Russians used thermal camouflaging to sneak up on Ukrainian positions in Avdiivka. Undetected by infrared, thermal imaging.  That they were not uniforms though, it was like sheets of this material, metalized film. (Im not translating that right...forgive me...)

Initially, with success.  Ultimately, lost in the close combat.

16758 Could be a nothing burger because only a small number of them were allocated to Ukraine, but with the video evidence coming from Kherson that Ukraine is using APKWS hydra munitions.  That would certainly make for a nifty tool to take out front line strongpoints during the beginning stages of a counter offensive.

16765 The anti-tank ditches near Ukraine's occupied southeastern town of Polohy stretch for 19 miles. Behind are rows of concrete ‚Äòdragon's teeth‚Äô barricades. Further back are defensive trenches where Russia's troops will be positioned.¬†  
The defenses visible in satellite imagery taken by Capella Space are part of a vast network of Russian fortifications sweeping down from western Russia through eastern Ukraine and onto Crimea built in readiness for a major Ukrainian attack.¬†  
Reuters has reviewed satellite images of thousands of defensive positions inside both Russia and along Ukrainian front lines that show it is most heavily defended in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and the gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.¬†  
Six military experts said the defenses, mostly built in the wake of Ukraine's rapid autumn advances, could make it harder for Ukraine this time and that progress would hinge on its ability to carry out complex, combined operations effectively.¬†

16778 [Previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12w0fj3/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jhgaek0/)

Day 425-427 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 3 days were mostly quiet, there were no new missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv after the pervious strike from a couple of days ago, though sadly they still used S-300 missiles to hit Kupiansk yesterday. They aimed at a museum, killing 2 women and injuring around 10 more people that were inside and/or near the building. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, which is probably the exact reason why they chose to hit it, so that they won‚Äôt hit anything military related by mistake.

I almost forgot that 3 days ago was the 1-year anniversary since our apartment building was directly hit by a Grad missile. That was definitely one of the worst days of this war for us and our neighbors, pretty hard to believe that it has actually been that long, it feels like much less time has passed. It‚Äôs now also incomparably more peaceful here in the city, even counting the occasional missile strikes it almost feels like there‚Äôs no war at all when comparing the current situation to the first few months of the war with the constant shelling.

Also, there are some pretty funny, but also very concerning reports coming from people living in Izyum about crows/ravens that take mines and spread them in previously demined places. Not sure if there are any officially confirmed cases of it happening, but the ‚Äúpetal‚Äù anti-personnel mines only weigh 80 grams so a crow could probably carry and drop them in some random places. Crows bombarding our cities with AP mines is definitely not something I thought we would need to worry about.

16793 ‚ÄúMy colleagues left me wounded on the field. I crawled through the woods for four days and crawled out to the Ukrainian positions,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äî the first captured russian from the "Redut" PMC, who managed to get captured.

"Redut" is a private military company of Gazprom, formed quite recently.

He says: ‚ÄúI am Tkachenko Alexey Ivanovich. Born in 1975. From Orenburg. I worked as a security guard at Gazprom, now I am a contract soldier for PMC Redut. Got there from Gazprom. We were trained in Tambov. Gazprom created divisions ‚ÄòTorch‚Äô, ‚ÄòFlow‚Äô and ‚ÄòFlame‚Äô. Two divisions: Torch and Flame were transferred to the Ministry of Defense. "Flame" was transferred to the Redut.

My last battle: I was in position, mortar shelling began, I was wounded and I asked for evacuation. At 7 pm I was evacuated. I was carried by two, while they were carrying me, they left me on the field and told me that "we'll reconnoiter the situation and come back", they left, but never came back for me, I was left alone. Wounded, I crawled through the forest for 4 days and crawled out to the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.‚Äô‚Äô

The first captured russian from the "Redut" PMC, who managed to get captured in #Bakhmut.

He says:

‚ÄúI have a shrapnel wound to my eye. I am also wounded in both arms (he shows), here and in the hand, and two fragments here (shows the hand), in the other hand too (shrapnel), in the leg: thigh and lower leg. The AFU bandaged me and gave me first aid. 

What happened to my colleagues who were with me on the position, I don‚Äôt know. I want to tell my colleagues at Gazprom: don‚Äôt go to Ukraine, stay at home.

I met other Wagner fighters from the 20th Assault Squad. The Wagnerites were awakened at night and told to leave. Where they went I don't know. And we took their positions in the forest belt near the road north of Bakhmut‚Äù

16801 **update on explosion** ***tonight*** **in Russia**


*Background: about 4hrs ago, Russian social media went into overdrive about an explosion in Pushkin.  Reading the various info, it seems to be related to the* [military-civilian airfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushkin_Airport).

The @vchkogpu channel^1 has video, although it‚Äôs just security cams where can hear the explosion.

Video: https://t\.me/s/vchkogpu

They report 4hrs ago:

> An explosion in St. Petersburg [direction]. State of emergency reports come from the Pushkinsky *district* and the Gatchina *region* of the Leningrad Oblast. Perhaps a drone attack is underway.

Then later: 

> **...the explosion was in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe 20th aircraft repair plant, which is currently housing military aircraft.**

then 2 hours ago:

> **...the target of the explosion was the Pushkin airfield; it‚Äôs located next to the 20th aircraft repair plant. Military aircraft are there for repairs, including those taking part in the ‚ÄòSVO‚Äô**

______

I posted this below, in a larger in response to 
u/acox199318 



First, is that there‚Äôs a flood of messages coming out of Pushkin (a historic town, about an hour south of St Pete, iirc) about an explosion.  
The Russian news agency (independent) *Fontanka* wrote that Rosgvardia we‚Äôre searching for source and regional guv refuses to comment.

Note that there‚Äôs an [airfield there](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=12K1wklSw5RA4iFNU4Rx8-4k1N7M&hl=en_US&ll=59.65514768804766%2C30.5096443906113&z=9).^2

  Seems that he‚Äôs been in trenches outside Khromove or Ivanivske.  He says doesn‚Äôt see much Wagner, much more regular RF military

Hertling now says about to enter phase 6.  The upcoming offensive of UA is going to be a different skill set, will require extraordinary coordination, and the results (casualties) will be different.  Like the ratio.  The clash of offense to defense will be felt. 

Referencing US Eu commanders statements‚Äîthat RF has greatly increased number of soldiers, how more now than beginning of war, Hertling says RF has learned that they were woefully unmanned for the task of taking Ukraine.  But UA has too. They have more defenders now, too.  Russia will be defending, which will be easier for them, and so it‚Äôll look to us they‚Äôve gotten better. But it‚Äôs just a different task, and had time.  To see that they‚Äôre still uncoordinated, look at how their planes can‚Äôt work in ground coordination with ground forces, they‚Äôve never gotten better there.

New guy posted:

> For several days in a row, the Russians have not advanced on our part of the front. However, this does not make it safer‚Äîthey use artillery with the same intensity as before. Enemy air raids did not disappear anywhere. They continue to use aviation, but it has not become a dominant component of the enemy's offensive capabilities. Our military, in turn, is doing everything possible to defeat the enemy as much as possible. 

He also said this troubling bit:

> The occupiers continue to detain the local population who have different views from them, or simply do not like them. People disappear in an unknown direction and often do not return.

> One of the places where Ukrainians are kept is the property of the former animal farm near Kreminna. It is there, according to witnesses, that some of the people detained in Svatove area are staying on suspicion of cooperation with Ukraine.

Unfortunately Bitik didn't make it and died: he leaves behind his wife and a son. Corrado, wounded in the shoulder, is hospitalized in the Kherson civil hospital. "We passed three checkpoints, Bogdan talked to the Ukrainian military and they let us pass without problems. It wasn't a fighting zone. Then we got hit, I heard a hiss and I saw Bogdan on the ground, he wasn't moving. I crawled out of the line of fire. I ran until I passed a civilian car. I was full of blood, I had to be taken to hospital in Kherson. I have four wounds but I was treated perfectly. I tried several times to call Bogdan, he didn't answer. He was a great friend of mine, it's excruciating suffering," Corrado told us on the phone.

>The Russian Navy has a new problem in the Black Sea. Ukrainian group Brave-1 have shown their Toloka weaponized UUV (uncrewed underwater vehicle). The design is evidently intended to operate as a form of loitering torpedo.

>This is a natural evolution of Ukraine‚Äôs maritime drones which are uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) packed with explosives. Being an underwater vehicle it is less prone to detection and harder to neutralize with gunfire. Its warhead is also impacting below the waterline so may be more likely to sink its target..

>Although it has now been shown publicly by Brave-1, it is unclear whether it is being used operationally. Multiple versions are expected, including one which is 4 meters long and claimed to have a range of 1200 km or 400 km operation radius. The figures may be ambitious, but the project is interesting and clearly has potential.

16822 'RU science/likely intelligence ship Akademik Fedorov has stopped above the deeper parts of Baltics.

Location is about the same that has garnered so much attraction from western submarine ops the last weeks.

AF is(was?) equipped with  2 mini-submarines capable of dives to 4km.

Yesterday she received a warm welcome home from 7 naval vessels after a long trip from Southern Ocean/Antactica(?).

I have not seen anyone follow her on AIS during the day, but the MO of swedish navy is more discreet than others.

Lets call this coincidence #103 in this part of the Baltics the last weeks. 

I am rephrasing this from wild guess to hunch: There is something lurking in the depths.

[...]

Akademik Fedorov actually was appreciated by an eight partner for her Baltic dance:

a Latvian patrol boat checked her out at about 14:00-16:00U, eyeball distances. In between North Gotland and Latvia.

Akademik Fedorov is stationary above the subsurface valleys that are the deeper parts of Baltics.

Her track shows her slowing down passing Bornholm yesterday, an action at least I would do when I do not want to be early to a destination. She got ~8hrs of darkness for? Something.

16823 Bakhmut

The maps the western analysts produce are *starting* to catch up with what the UA Bakhmut milbloggers draw up‚Äîshowing, sadly, the very large gains the Russians have made. 

Ukraine remains only in a *portion* of just the western section of Bakhmut.  Basically, from Korsunskogo up to medical college (contested), over to the Pushkin Lanes (contested).
This still gives them many, many high-rises on Tchaikovsky going west.  And they still control the exit corridors.

Several of the bakhmut soldiers and milbloggers guys have gone silent [may be ordered to do so, might be operation, might be withdrawal, etc.].  Today, @myrosh_nykov announced he‚Äôd no longer give even general  locations, for operational security.  Others are defying advice and continuing to give specifics.  

Several mentioned that the Russians had bragged on a victory at Khromove that didn‚Äôt exist...

Overall, no good news.  But we know aid is coming.  Hopefully, soon. 



The tone of the channels of the guys serving in or reporting from bakhmut who posted today was more like this, from DeepStateUA:

> The situation in Bakhmut is extremely difficult. No changes on the route through Khromove. The information that the Russians have taken it is a fake. But *in* the city itself, the enemy has significant success along the entire line of contact, except for the ["airplane" area.](https://goo.gl/maps/xsUZc6wc2yhDvz2j9)
According to preliminary data, the Russians have now reached the [intersection of Yuvileynaya and Tchaikovsky](https://goo.gl/maps/ForsBenFNZsUEg6c9). [that‚Äôs the road that turns into O0506‚Äîit also is in a high rise area and whoever has height is poised to keep it‚Äîthis would be very bad, but it‚Äôs just preliminary...]

Later, got more ominous...

> The enemy is drawing up reserves and preparing artillery for the final assault on the western part of Bakhmut. 

> In Bakhmut, the last four [controlled areas] are not so great because of enemy artillery, and also because of the reduction of our control zone, this hell has grown exponentially. 

> The defenders‚Äîsoldiers of the Armed Forces, Territorial Defense, Transport, Security Service, Border Guards, and others‚Äîare doing everything possible to ensure that the western part of the city holds out, as long as possible; but in the situation that has now developed, the main thing is to protect the lives of the personnel, who have already done everything that was in their power.  [mirrors words before severdonetsk; but could just be cliche phrasing]

And btw, the Russians are using drones in Bakhmut‚Äîtheyre not the best, the attack drones get shot down in large numbers, but still RF has copied UA and have some success.

16830 TL;DR ‚Äî from the article:

* Russia's cutting-edge T-14 Armata tanks have arrived in Ukraine, state media reported.
* But the high-tech armored vehicles have yet to truly get in on the action of the war.
* The T-14 program has been plagued by setbacks in recent months.
* "If Russia deploys T-14, it will likely primarily be for propaganda purposes," the British Defense Ministry said in January. "Production is probably only in the low tens, while commanders are unlikely to trust the vehicle in combat."

16846 ‚ö°Ô∏èThe advance of the Russians in Bakhmut has stopped.  The Russians have continued their ground attacks in and around the city, but have not made any territorial gains in the last two days, - Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Regarding the situation in Uhledar, a few days ago, the Russians launched a series of large air strikes on this city.

However, ISW continues to believe that the Russian forces lack the combat power necessary for a meaningful offensive in the Vhledar direction, especially while the battle for Bakhmut is going on.

16847 An intercepted call reveals the morale of the Russian troops during the February Vuhledar kamikaze column burning. In this call, the Russian soldier tells his wife that "so many of our boys were burned inside the tanks". Reacting to her question about equipment delivery, he says it's all being stolen, and the Donbas people (separatists) are similar to a criminal bandit gang in their dealings.

He also mentions the 70th regiment which was one of the first to enter Ukraine in Feb-Mar last year, the "elite" unit which took enormous casualties and was abandoned by contract soldiers. The regiment is now under the risk of having it banner withdrawn.

16848 I was gathering some data for last weeks. There are multiple sources, including posts, videos etc. I'm planning to make a full article about BTG and why we don't see them recently. During gathering the information process I found some interesting reports (OSINT, so nothing classified), used some math and I think that data itself is interesting enough to post.

Those numbers represent not a point in time, but maybe summary taken across about 2 weeks, so they can be off by a few percent, but not more.

Russia in Ukraine has total of:

- 1750 tanks

- 4300 armored vehicles (anything that is not a tank, but still has armor - so from BMP to MT-LB)

- less than 2900 barrel artillery


- less than 850 rocket artillery


Those numbers include every single vehicles in any state that is not crossed out from the unit (so anything from fully combat ready T-90M to T-62 without the tower that someone was able to drive home) and vehicles in process of being repaired. As of two weeks ago 38% of tanks from this number had status "under repair". 

What is even more important - no reserves. Checking around other military units around Russia - there is nothing. No more tanks in active service nor artillery. A few units are defending Moscow and surroundings , few AA setups are defending air bases, but there are no tanks, no armored vehicles, no artillery in active service that can otherwise be sent to Ukraine. This number doesn't include manufactured tanks or tanks being restored from long term cold storage.

So yes, Russia is fully committed in Ukraine. I have similar numbers about manpower, but I'm still in the process of verification of that data. Hope someone will find it useful.


Edit: I'm just reading interesting report. The pearl in RUAF tank force - T-90M - was found to be hardly serviceable in field conditions. Any repairs need to be done in properly equipped repair shop. Looks like even T-80 with it's turbine engine is easier to maintain and repair. I find it dubious, but that's what it says.

16851 According to Syrsky, the further defense of Bakhmut is important for several reasons: it ensures the stability of the defense of the group of troops as a whole; 

Bakhmut is a well-placed natural fortress, surrounded by rivers and placed on hills; 

the presence of high-rise buildings and developed infrastructure on the left bank of the Bakhmutovka River, where our troops are defending, also contributes to the protection of the city; 

this type of combat requires special skills and creates difficulties for the troops who are on the offensive in the conditions of the forest-steppe; 

Bakhmut is part of the Kostiantynivsk-Kramatorsk agglomeration, the holding of which excludes the enemy's exit to the flank and rear of the groups of our troops in the Lysychansk and Donetsk directions. https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/sirskiy-prostimi-slovami-poyasniv-dotsilnist-1682418565.html

16855 From CNN:

Ukraine's military has claimed it is achieving ‚Äúimpressive results‚Äù against Russian forces on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson.

‚ÄúOver the past three days, we have quite impressive results of our combat work,‚Äù the spokeswoman for Ukraine‚Äôs Southern Command said in a national broadcast Tuesday.

‚ÄúWe have managed to hit and destroy artillery pieces, tanks, vehicles, armored vehicles, and enemy air defense systems,‚Äù Natalia Humeniuk said. ‚ÄúIn other words, our work on clearing the front line of the east bank is quite powerful, but we are still working in a counter-battery mode.‚Äù
Humeniuk hinted that further developments would be expected in the near future. She went on to say Russian evacuations from the banks of the Dnipro were also facilitating Ukrainian operations.

‚ÄúThey [the Russians] are also clearing the territory of the local population, which makes our work much easier, because they are trying to evacuate the locals there where they are moving their units and moving to new locations,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúTherefore, it is safer for us to carry out our work at combat positions where they are no longer hiding behind the locals.‚Äù

Some background: Speaking to CNN earlier this week, Yurii Sobolevskyi, first deputy head of Ukraine‚Äôs Kherson regional council, said about 30% of the pre-war population remains in the temporarily occupied territories of the Kherson region.

‚ÄúIt is very difficult to calculate because we have no access to data on the number of active subscribers from mobile operators and other means,‚Äù he said.

In the interview, Sobolevskyi claimed that for the past two weeks the Russians had been trying to coerce civilians in towns on the river to leave their homes.

It released a video of the wreckage on social media.

16871 I have a theory. Remember the S-300s that were destroyed recently? So I'm thinking that Ukraine tried to move its launchers closer to deal with Russian planes that were hitting Bakhmut with FAB bombs. But the Russians were ready for this and picked off the launchers with Lancets. Reasonable?

According to the report:

SA-10 (S-300) and SA-11 (BUK) comprise of 89% of Ukraine's AD medium/high range.

BUK will be depleted by 31st March 2023

S-300 Will be depleted by 02 May 2023.

16874 NOTES on this (excellent) podcast by Geopolitics Decanted.

https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/how-can-ukraine-survive-the-exhaustion-of-its-air-defense-stocks

1. Ukr has mainly been using the soviet stockpile of s300's, buks etc, which cover all flight envelopes and provide a mix of short medium and long range. (Their own stockpile plus the stockpiles of various ex-soviet nato states). The soviets developed and built thousands of GBAD systems the way we built out fighter jets

2. These stockpiles are running low and only russia has the designs to build more. There hasnt been much work on reverse engineering the systems.

3. Nato air defenses such as patriot, nasams, etc are pretty good, but not quite as good as the soviet systems. But there are simply not THAT many of them, since NATO never focused on GBAD (ground based AD), instead focusing on air superiority. There are loads and loads of short range manpads available but not THAT much of real SAMs.

4. These Nato AD are very important to keep in reserve for contingencies in Persian Gulf and in Taiwan/SCS theaters, where the missiles vs AD battle would be a HUGE HUGE factor. And where American interests are arguably significantly greater than in Ukr.

5. Ukr is using a bunch of its AD to suppress Artillery-Spotter-Drones, which range from baby quadcopters to Orlan-10s. The little quads can be shot down with an AK and some drones can be hit by a manpad, but the Orlan's are high enough they can only get whacked by a SAM. But a SAM costs way more than an Orlan and ofc the SAMs are running out. If Russia could fly Orlan's with impunity, it makes their artillery about 10x more powerful (and artillery is already Russia's main strength).

6. Russia has shitty and slow target acquisition and strike command. Himars for example are safe from missiles since it takes Ru so long between seeing one and a missile landing there. This would change a LOT if Ru could operate ground attack aircraft in Himars zones. So Ru has focused on using their long range missiles to strike stationary infrastructure rather than mobile assets. In turn Ukr has shifted a lot their AD to rear areas and therefore away from the frontlines.

7. Ukr therefore cant rely on AD forever. If they dont find a way to keep deterring the russian air force, which so far has been successfully deterred by GBAD, then the war will change a lot. To this end two recommendations are made. A small and powerful squadron of NATO air fighters could deter the Russian air force since they just dont have that many planes. Alternatively Ukr needs to find a way to asymmetrically damage Ru airbases and assets.

16876 One of the most interesting parts of the leaked documents is the estimation by the US that Ukraine now fields more tanks (802 vs. 419), IFVs/APCs etc. (3.498 vs. 2.928) and artillery pieces (2331 vs. 1209) than Russia. According to the same document, Russia has only 560 tanks left in storage. That would go against pretty much everything we assumed/knew so far.

16882 If these leaks are true, then that will explain a lot of things, particularly, why Russia never uses its massive airforce to gain air superiority.


"One document, dated in February, says missiles for the S300 will run out by May, while the SA-11 Gadfly missile system will be depleted by the end of March. Both systems make up 89 percent of Ukraine‚Äôs air defenses, according to NATO, and are crucial in fending off frequent Russian missile strikes"

https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3943086-us-intelligence-leak-deals-severe-blow-to-ukraine-war-effort


This is huge, the only reason Russia was unable to gain air superiority was Soviet S300 systems, this AA is so good and cheap that practically every non western country use it, I'm not sure about the complexity of the missles, but if they can't use non Russian made missles then simply put Ukraine is fucked. 89% of air defenses simply gone and useless is a game changer.


If USA wants to replace the AA's than that will cost tens of billions maybe even a hundred, and I highly highly doubt USA waste all of its modern AA on a fight with Russia and not China.




Maybe that's when Russia will decide to blow the bridges in dnipro, Ukraine has a limited time to try for an offensive, maybe that's why Western medias have been so vocal about Ukraine counter offensives, by summer they won't have any more AA's.



I said if and I want to state that I don't know what the fuck is going on, Ryber and several other Russian channels said that the leak is USA attempt at luring Russia to make a mistake, maybe that's true, maybe not, but if it's true, then that's where the momentum is really shifted towards Russia.

16883 Looking for a compilation of ukrainians fighting in or around Bakhmut I think. At first it showed a soldier outside firing an AK and then getting hit in the hand, then it went to another scene where ukrainian soldiers were in the woods and like 2-3 of them get sniped and then a comrade of theirs comes and lets them know another colleague died.

People do heinous things in war. I'm not confident that the ends justify the means, no matter which side you support.

In any case, this is a great glimpse into the type of people that NATO is supporting directly or indirectly. Ukrainian society is obviously not uniform in how to conclude this war, but there's an extremist contingency inside Ukraine that wants a hell of a lot more of what the above report describes.

EDIT: One testimonial that caught my eye.

16887 Far too little attention is paid to the fact that for more than 4 months Russia isn't able to push Ukraine back from Kreminna, despite them using parts of their best formations (like what is left of VDV) and equipment (Lancet, TOS, T-90M, BMP-T) against the UAF. There were almost no changes in the forest to the south of Kreminna.

Leaked U.S. military and intelligence documents indicate alarming Ukrainian shortfalls in Western-supplied weaponry ‚Äî especially ammunition and air defense ‚Äî even as they show deep American penetration into Russian plans, equipment and manpower

>The disclosures offer an extraordinarily detailed snapshot of battlefield conditions in the Ukraine war from late February and early March, as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the rate of Ukraine‚Äôs expenditure of ammunition was ‚Äúmany times higher‚Äù than the rate at which its benefactors could produce it.

>Air defense, to protect sensitive sites, military personnel and equipment and civilians, is also critical. According to one of the documents, a late February assessment from the Defense Department‚Äôs Joint Staff, Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúability to provide medium range air defense to protect the [front lines] will be completely reduced by May 23. UKR assessed to withstand 2-3 more wave strikes‚Äù from attacking Russian missiles and drones.

16896  Over the last few days, we've received various pieces of information, such as Ukraine withdrawing most of its units from Bakhmut, having to use parts of the Offensive Guard for defensive tasks in Luhansk regions, the White House indicating that Russia is planning to go on the offensive, and general information like the weather improving, making offensive action easier.

Furthermore, according to the Ukrainian military command, air attacks have significantly increased in comparison to the last few months. In December, 20 reported air attacks were unusually high, but now, 20 air attacks are considered a rather quiet day.

Finally, although anecdotal, there is one more piece of information to consider. Many of the recent Ukrainian military casualties are reported to have occurred not in Bakhmut but in Luhansk Oblast.

It appears that there is a competition to initiate the counteroffensive first, but it would be more advantageous to prioritize who can achieve greater success. While I want to believe that Ukraine has the upper hand, they are also under time pressure, even if they are unwilling to acknowledge it IMO

Considering the leopard2s spotted in odessa, and Ru evacuating civillians  from zaporozhnia, likely Ukraine is goint to start the offensive in 7-10th of may

Parts of it were evacuated from the front during WWII, what was left was occupied by germans (krupp), and destroyed as they left, so I guess much of the reconstruction probably from the 40s.

16965 So Ukraine couldn‚Äôt down their own UAV over Kiev that was flying at very low altitude for 30 mins but somehow managed to down a hypersonic ballistic missile. Not to mention the photos of the  ‚Äúballistic missile‚Äù that they shot down shows the missile almost perfectly still in tact. I‚Äôd imagine the missile would be blown up into bits and the left overs vaporized due to the speed that it‚Äôs flying. Ukraine has been getting increasingly cocky with the bullshit recently, almost as if they think the public will believe anything at this point. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , comment
16966 Guys just google khinzal, it is not possible to shutdown if it performs like described. Patriot cant come near...
The hypersonic missiles that Russia used in the attacks on Ukraine are known as "Kinzhals," or daggers. They are 8 meters long.

Some experts say this type of missile flies as fast as 6,000 kilometers per hour, which would be around Mach 5. Others say it flies at Mach 9 or even Mach 10.

Either way, it's fast. So fast, in fact, that "the air pressure in front of the weapon forms a plasma cloud as it moves, absorbing radio waves," the weapons experts at US website Military.com explain.

Putin has said that Russia is the global leader in hypersonic weaponsImage: Vadim Savitsky/Russian Defence Ministry/picture alliance
That makes "Kinzhal" and other hypersonic weapons very hard to catch on radar systems, an effect compunded by their low altitude.

Low altitude

Hypersonic missiles fly at a much lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles.

They follow what is known as a low atmospheric-ballistic trajectory. That means that by the time a radar-based missile defense system clocks them, they are already so close to their target that in many cases it is too late to intercept them.

On top of that, hypersonic missiles can change direction midflight.

What is their range?

The hypersonic missiles used by Russia in Ukraine are launched from aircrafts.

Other hypersonic weapons can be deployed from ships and submarines. And they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

The Kinzhal type can hit a target up to 2,000 kilometers away. Other hypersonic missiles have a reach of about 1,000 kilometers.

If hypersonic missiles were stationed in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, that would put several European capitals within their reach. Kaliningrad is separate from the Russian mainland and borders Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. The German capital Berlin is less than 600 kilometers away.

But some analysts say that despite the advantages that hypersonic missiles have over conventional ballistic weapons, Russia won't use them indiscriminately. US Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck told a US Senate Armed Services subcommittee in May 2022 that Russia was having "challenges with some of their hypersonic missiles as far as accuracy" was concerned in Ukraine.

https://nitter.it/i/status/1600195434915409920

That you can hear the sound of the shell fire and after 6-8 seconds it lands - making it impossible to be launched from ua controlled territory. Also, the trajectory of the landing confirms the case. 

So, nothing new. But russia fanboys gonna fanboy anyway. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , comment
16976 Big difference here, assuming it is UAF shelling that has caused this particular tragedy. You have a shell hole in the middle of a street, and unfortunate victims caught by shrapnel in broad daylight.

The other alternative is a RU cruise missile targeting an entire apartment block complex at 4 a.m. when they are full of sleeping innocent civilians mainly women & children & the elderly.

So inadvertent shelling within a contested war zone catching innocent members of the public unawares, or targeting cruise missiles at apartment blocks in the middle of the night when people are in bed & killings dozens in the process.... which is the biggest war crime.

ruZZia is a terrorist state, led by a wanted war criminal!

[Found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCbD4WBqPg4), it's a 3 part video of his first months fighting in Ukraine.

\*Russian, like many languages, does not distinguish between towns and cities.  There is no word for town, the word city is used for both.  However, in order to fill this semantic gap, many times the phrase "population center" or "populated area" is used.  The term is a bit ambiguous as it can either literally mean "place where many people live" or "bigger than village but not quite a city".

Shortly after everyone saw the videos, klitschko clarfied and rather akwardly stated that the shot TB2 somehow caused two crash sites.

The problem is, the 4 story apartment was damaged around 10 minutes before the TB2 was intercepted. Ironically, you can also find a video of a failed missile intercept.

Not sure why this isn't discussed more when ukraines narritave has more plot holes than swiss cheese.

TL:DR: Ukrainian AA missile actually caused the damage to the apartment building which they initally attrributed to the russians before TB2 videos released and never bothered to fix the plot hole.

17045 During his visit to the Southern Military District, the Minister of Defence inspected the readiness of military equipment and weapons that were sent to the front lines.

Kuzmenkov, the newly appointed Deputy Defence Minister in charge of logistics, presented Shoigu with the latest batches of modern tanks, combat vehicles, and other equipment. 

The minister also examined the bases for storing and repairing weapons and military equipment that were withdrawn from the combat areas. 

Shoigu tasked Kuzmenkov with keeping a close eye on the continuous and rhythmic supply of troops with all the necessary weapons and military equipment in the Northern Military District. 

At the joint group of troops headquarters, Shoigu listened to reports from the Deputy Ministers of Defence and group commanders about the current situation and future plans.

The speaker Yuriy Ignat, denied the statements of individual representatives of the Kyiv administration about the downing of the Russian hypersonic missile "Kinzhal‚Äù . 

>I have already refuted it a thousand times, you should have seen it yesterday. There was a possibility of use, but ballistic missiles were not recorded. 

Ukraine has confirmed before that they have no means to intercept these hypersonic missiles. It is currently unknown if a Patroit system has the ability to do so.

17068 UA POV: Kremlin Drone Attack doesn‚Äôt look like false flag - The Guardian 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17069 Some details we should take into consideration:

- the type of drones used appeared to be small. So if they where launched it was most likely from close. the SBU or KGB should have launched it from near or in Moscow. Launching from Ukraine territory is unlikely.

- the area around the Kremlin should be jammed by GPS. So normal drones shouldn't come close. That means or the jamming was off (false flag attack) or really sophisticated drones where used (why use a little explosives then?).

- SBU have operated in Belarusian territory before (to damage the planes that where used for recon) also another drones crashed in the forest south of Moscow (bigger drone, so the deniability of Ukraine that they wouldn't attack Russia territory said by Zelenski is false)

Currently it's still unclear what happened and Russia should provide more info regarding the attack.

17083 My armchair general senses tell me that Russia did exact same thing as Ukraine to Kremlin. They launched drone somewhere near Kiev and let it fly low. It could explain how it wasn't shot down earlier.

Other thing is that it was obviously a probing "attack" as well as demonstration of "we can do that kind of stuff too if we want to".

And it took them 20 min to take down a single drone, but we'll see if there will be any follow up after this.

17089 UA POV - Ukrainian Security Service detained prorussian informer as a result of a multi-stage special operation in the Mykolaiv Oblast. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17090 Military counter-intelligence of the Ukrainian Security Service detained another enemy informer as a result of a multi-stage special operation in the Mykolaiv Oblast.

The perpetrator turned out to be a resident of Crimea, who in 2014 supported the Russian invaders and remained on the territory of the temporarily occupied peninsula.

There he received a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and voluntarily entered the Russian military.

Later, a representative of the Russian special service came to him with a "proposal" for secret cooperation.

At the instruction of the aggressor, before the start of the full-scale invasion, the suspect arrived in the Mykolaiv Oblast, where his relatives live.

In the territory of the southern region, he was supposed to collect intelligence about the locations and movements of Ukrainian troops.

Last year, he was mobilized to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Being in the ranks of (one of the Ukrainian military units), the attacker spied on the movement of combat aircraft and the positions of the air defense system of our country.

He was also interested in information about warehouses with ammunition and fuel and lubricants of the Defense Forces.

Ukrainian SBU employees detained him, while he was involved carrying out an enemy intelligence mission.

According to the investigation, he transmitted the obtained information remotely to the occupiers through his ex-wife, who lives in Crimea and is in the field of view of the Russian special services.

He used an anonymous messenger for communication.

On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the detainee of the suspicion under Part 1 of Art.

114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the transfer, transfer of weapons, armaments and military supplies to Ukraine, the movement, transfer or placement of the Armed Forces or other military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine).

An investigation is currently underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime. Comprehensive measures were carried out under the procedural leadership of the Mykolaiv specialized prosecutor's office in the field of defense of the Southern region.

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17129 There is an opinion that a Russian Korsar UAV was shot down over Kiev (pic 1), since I do not have the necessary knowledge, I bring to the discussion the opinion of more knowledgeable people with Lostarmour. In their opinion, Bayraktar is indicated by the presence of a "suspension point under the wing" (pic 2)(pink), as well as the visible OLS (Optical Location Station) (yellow). In addition, unlike the Corsair, "the Bayraktar has a chassis under the belly, the Korsar has wings" (pic 3). And that there is no doubt - "Bayraktar has characteristic outlines, including smooth transitions from the hull to the wings, while the Korsar has a right angle there" (pic 4,5,6).

17214 Does nobody question the fact that these slow ass drones apperantly flew like 500+ kilometers during night, having infinite "fuel", never getting detected or shot down till right above the kremlin, with one drone just casually popping near the top of the flag, while we have seen videos of pilots flying  drones straight into russian soldiers asses hiding in trenches. 

What a crazy assasination attempt wow i cant believe ukraine would do that! . Its not like the kremlin is a phone booth at the side of the road that they tried to hit a guy in. Russian propaganda is somethign else. Also them randomly shooting down another drone later somehwere else like they send more drones over but "phew", we averted them guys, feel better getting conscrpted now, you are in danger, we are under attack.

17261 Personally, the only drone that small that could reach Moscow from Ukraine would have to be a winged version.  Even then, it's a long shot.

The drone looks like a quad-copter type.  These have a range of 5--10 km, with a payload.

So either a Ukrainian team operating around Moscow; or pro-Ukrainian Russians; or anti-Putin Russians.

Of course, possibly a false flag, but it probably would have been a larger attack and done more damage for that to be effective.

How many mysterious fires have occurred at recruitment centers, arms factories and how many train derailments?

17311  As for the drones over the Kremlin. It‚Äôs all predictable... Russia is clearly preparing a large-scale terrorist attack. That's why it first detains a large allegedly subversive group in Crimea. And then it demonstrates "drones over the Kremlin". First of all, Ukraine wages an exclusively defensive war and does not attack targets on the territory of the Russian Federation. What for? This does not solve any military issue. But it gives RF grounds to justify its attacks on civilians... Secondly, we are watching with interest the growing number of mishaps and incidents that are taking place in different parts of RF. The emergence of unidentified unmanned aerial vehicles at energy facilities or on Kremlin‚Äôs territory can only indicate the guerilla activities of local resistance forces. As you know, drones can be bought at any military store... The loss of power control over the country by Putin‚Äôs clan is obvious. But on the other hand, Russia has repeatedly talked about its total control over the air. In a word, something is happening in RF, but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin...

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17325  

Hysteria on Russian air force bases as they can't figure out where the real-time leaks are coming from to Osechkin.

right now about Russian bombers getting equipped with nuclear warheads:

"There is no clear strategy, the aim is to terrify and cause chaos. The Service (FSB) is being redirected to counter a coup. The wheels have come off and no one has any clue of what's going on.

The documents have not been completed for the "red button" mechanism. (for nuclear launch)

This is raising the stakes and insanity."

o Osechkin right now:

"Hello, my name is \_\_\_\_, 47th Air Regiment Military Unit 105117, 105th Air Division.

I am a Tu-22M3 bomber pilot.

They are trying to force me to launch Kalibr missiles at downtown Kyiv. Every mechanic knows - those are nuclear warheads. Takeoff around 5am. There are some delays due to mechanics, but overall everything appears to going according to plan.

I will not launch these missiles. Worst case - I will launch them toward the ocean, or destroy myself along with the plane. Than you for opening my eyes to the criminality of this war. Glory to Ukraine"

From: 55th Special Purpose Regiment

"We are preparing for take off in 30 minutes. We already have the order. Spoke with the pilot, this is insane."

Osechkin after a call with a source: In DVKR, long-range aviation, VKS - everyone is shocked with the lack of clarity and the orders so far. Also by the constant real-time leaks. There are no written orders from Putin at this time. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , comment
17326  BREAKING: Russia may launch missile strikes on Kyiv this night. Two nuclear warheads allegedly at the airfield but not armed on the planes at this time.  Osechkin's source: "Orders have been sent to the air bases in Engels and Shaykovka to prepare a number of TU-22Ms for flight, missile strikes could be carried out on a number of administrative buildings in Kiev during the night."  Osechkin: "The source also claimed that for the first time nuclear weapons may be used, at least two 'items' are already located directly at one of the aforementioned airfields.  P.S. Details will be provided later. It is important to understand that a long-range aviation source is risking his life, namely the risk of going to prison for life. And this is not a hype or a gimmick, today everything is very serious and it is not known how it will end. We are not talking about a monkey with a grenade, we are all dealing with (or rather confronting) a dictator with nuclear weapons. And if he decides to use nuclear weapons, we hope that the pilots and specialists of the ground services of the Air Force will not carry out this criminal order." 

&#x200B;

 Osechkin has now received more than 10 messages from various sources at Russian Air Force bases which have been placed on "combat ready" status.  Large-scale missile strikes on Ukraine are reportedly being prepared for this night and early morning. 

 Details from Osechkin's sources: - Take off scheduled for 4:00am. (Current time is 2:08am) - Flight time to launch location of cruise missiles is 1 hour. - Bomber windows have been tinted to prevent identification of plane crew. 

&#x200B;

 Osechkin is informing Russian pilots that they have no anonymity - he has all of their information based on thousands of documents leaked to him. This is Air Force Captain Grishko, who previously flew Su-35S in Syria.  ( with picture on the phone on the tread )

  More Russian pilots. Colonel and Lt. Colonel. ( with pictures on phone )

 Osechkin is letting the pilots know that no tinted windows will protect them if they commit these war crimes. They will be identified and exposed. 

 Osechkin has information that 1/3 of aviators at Engels air force base have submitted pending resignations/retirements. Around 50% of officers at Engels have no desire to partake in this illegal war based on his sources. Many are essentially hostages there right now. 

 On livestream, Osechkin is addressing Major General Pchela Oleg Vladimirovich (dob Nov 14,  1970) and his Senior Navigator, Colonel Baranov Oleg Yuriyvich Address: Engels-1, house number starts with '8' - making a point so they understand they have no anonymity.  Regiment Commander, Colonel Skitsky Oleg Igorevich dob 1980, Squadron Leader Lt. Colonel Volkovisky Sergei Ivanovich dob 1973, his crew Elkin, Malinin...

17327 From his stream: "I'm a pilot with Calibers with nuclear warheads, aimed at Kyiv center. Before we at least targeted military. The schedule is for 5AM. I'm not gonna shoot those, I'll shoot them into the sea, or will down a plane with me."  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35fuKoCgb6g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35fuKoCgb6g) (russian)

I'm kind of suspicious that a pilot wouldn't know missile destination, right? Could be just some FSB or CIA or some redditor messaging that Osechkin.

Edit: the last assumption was right, he was fooled

17328 Looks like something went down in Kyiv last night: https://twitter.com/Mylovanov/status/1653923570404274176?t=pxxi4LD0zrjmnXD-du3YXg&s=19

But apparently it was air defense and not much else happened.

Because Russia a) just attacked Ukraine a few days ago, and needs to build more missiles first b) might fight internally if it even makes sense to damage official buildings in Kyiv for show instead of using them on military targets and 3) is not crazy enough to use nukes because someone damaged the senate building's roof.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, commander of the Wagner Group private military company (PMC), has claimed that militants from his PMC destroyed an armoured vehicle while Major General Ihor Tantsiura, commander of the Territorial Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was inside it. According to Ukrainska Pravda sources in the military, this is a lie.

**Source:** Prigozhin‚Äôs Telegram channel; informed sources of Ukrainska Pravda in the military

**Quote:** "At 13:25 today, artillery units of Wagner PMC destroyed an armoured vehicle believed to be carrying Ihor Tantsiura, commander of the Territorial Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, during the transfer of reserves from the settlement of Chasiv Yar to the settlement of Bakhmut." \[Prigozhin pronounced his last name as "Sansura" which could have been either a mere slip, or a result of his speech impediment ‚Äì ed.\]

**Details:** Prigozhin claimed that Tantsiura was heading to the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast. He added that this information is being clarified.

However, Ukrainska Pravda sources in the military stated that "this information is not true".

In particular, Territorial Defence Spokesman Denys Zelinskyi said in a comment to Ukrainska Pravda that everyone in the ranks of the Armed Forces is "alive and well".

**Background:** President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed Major General Ihor Ivanovich Tantsiura as the commander of the Territorial Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on 15 May 2022.

17384 I wondered a bit about everything in this attack..

First: 8 ballistic missiles on a train?

Second: no casualties inside the city.

A weak statesment from the Ukraine about a chemical plant hit.

So I started Google maps of the area, and what I found:

https://www.google.de/maps/place/Pavlohrad,+Dnipropetrovsk+Oblast,+Ukraine,+51400/@48.5805677,35.8491621,897m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x40deb832704b48ff:0x965a7131844da73d!8m2!3d48.5294478!4d35.9032574!16zL20vMGI1OWg0!5m2!1e4!1e2

Military storage facility, with train tracks going in and 8 major storage buildings, each about 3000sqm size with blast walls around them and some look way too nice and maintained for a decommissioned and forgotten site. 

The chemical factory in the city looks more like a pharmaceutical plant. Nothing too big and fancy. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , comment
17385 First man served in "4th Regiment for the Protection of Particularly Important State Facilities". Given that Ukrainian sources say that he was killed at a military post - it means that the Russians really hit something "important" since such a unit protected this place.

Second man served in unnamed military unit, but he killed 1 May - rather than 30 April when killed first man. This date may mean that he died from another shelling, because that day there were still Russian shelling (probably on a different target).

plus a few of them with Drones

losing ground today ( funny fact there is no maps from Wagner for the last few days ) in Bakhmut, losing ground in a few more places, trains blowing up a few times in Russia

high moral newly equipped with all the training

I think the most important will be those hundreds of thousand of drones that will drop grenades, and i still remembered that loads of people just made so many jokes about them

17423 " The current number of HIMARS rocket launchers (about 35 units)"

Even RT is telling us that Ukraine still has 35 launchers left? Dang, that's more than I thought UKraine had. That's actually pretty significant.

  " There is currently no doctrine or tested recommendations on using HIMARS/M270 MLRS in combined arms warfare or in such a large-scale war against a technologically advanced enemy. "

Thank Russia for being the test subject of the field test combined arms warfare doctrines incorporating these weapon systems. Such awesome chaps.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, all things said and done. I'm also sceptical of large successes during the counteroffensiv. I think the past half year has shown that the front has devolved into trench warfare, with Russian armored pushes having had their noses bloodied. I see no reason just yet why the Ukrainians wouldn't suffer a similar fate to what they did in Kherson. That offensive only succeeded in a relatively short term because of the logistical bottleneck created.

So to my untutored mind it looks most probable they took out something of significant value to Ukraine.

Is there video of an incoming missile or could it have been an accident/sabotage, maybe trying to recycle the fuel into some DIY missile ?

17439 On the kalibr missile decoy

Its mass is in the range of 25% of the airlaunched kalibr. It is way cheaper (remember though that cost is a proxy for production time) and less complex. What does it do? It drains Ukrainian air defence missile stockpiles and may increase kalibr survivability. Russia is not producing these instead of kalibrs. It is producing them in addition to kalibrs (production line requirements are different).

Is Russian use of decoys problematic? Yes. Ukraine is betting on being able to keep up with Russian missile production. Decoy use changes the odds of that bet. The backdrop here is depleted Ukrainian air defences lets loose the Russian airforce. Which Ukraine cannot allow to happen.

He added that even though the battle in Bakhmut is still ongoing, Ukraine made advances while Russia has not."

17467 I checked the cruise missiles number, because I always wondered if they count every used cruise missile (because even the ones that hit the targets are "lost") or only the ones they shot down. It seems they do neither of this.

For 28.04.2023

more than 20 launched, 11 claimed to be shot down. I think Ukraine counted them on april 29. And counted all (?) that were launched.

For 01.05.2023:

[https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-says-intercepted-15-russian-145335653.html](https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-says-intercepted-15-russian-145335653.html)

18 launched, 15 claimed to be shot down. Ukraine counted (on may 2nd)  only the ones that were shut down, not the ones that hit a target.

They seem to ignore the attack on april 30, which is talked about in the yahoo source.

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17473 It seems the target was the Pavlograd Chemical plant. This plant had been turned into a n SS-24 disposal site as part of Cold War disarmament treaties and the fuel in the missiles was extracted and used for commercial or other military purposes. For example the GROM-2 ballistic missile similar to Iskander (which may have been used against targets in Crimea) probably used fuel derived from these old ICBMs. Probably a good idea to destroy these missiles, fuel and industrial capacity.

The other explanation is, that the Russians arranged them after the death like this. But looting clothes of dead Ukrainians would be incredibly pointless, because the clothes would have been destroyed by artillery or bullet wounds.   

Maybe videos of this will pop up after some time. Russians like to film their warcrimes and are often too proud of them to keep them silent.

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17514 Why Russia is afraid of Ukraine's Neptune missiles

16:40, 09.06.20204 min.50992

Neptune is a top-secret Ukrainian project that any NATO country could be proud of. It's a cruise anti-ship missile able to deter the Russian fleet in the Black or Azov Seas. Flying at the fighter jet speed at ultra-low altitudes, just a few meters above the sea surface, it's invisible to enemy radars.

Detailed test information is naturally classified. We only know that in May, two Neptunes hit the target exactly 85 km and 110 km off Ukraine coast. But it seems that Russia's intelligence services already know more about Neptune than we think.

In early May, a Russian agent in Ukraine acquired from the Ukrainian military, who attended the Neptune tests part of the documentation on the new missile project.

The FSB is interested in the real engineering gem of the project ‚Äì the cruise missile's homing head.

Ukrainian officers convinced the Russian agent they were ready to sell more documents to get more money. The bait worked.

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

In fact, we witnessed a Ukrainian counterintelligence undercover sting raid. The military carried candid cameras on them. As soon as the agent receives from them part of the documentation, security operatives nab him red-handed.

His name is Oleksandr Rushchak. He has long got used to prison, having spent half of his life behind bars ‚Äì that's over 20 years ‚Äì with short breaks of freedom.

"I preach prisoner lifestyle. I'm neither for Ukraine nor for Russia," he says.

He doesn't look like a spy. He claims he was only a courier. He contacted the FSB handlers only by phone, he says, and sent them photos of documents. He would then get the money from caches set up for him.

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

"I got a call from a man named Valeriy who said he was with the FSB. I was supposed to hand over the materials to that guy Valery," says Oleksandr Rushchak.

The Russian side seems to have known in advance the servicemen who have access to classified information about the Neptune project. But how did they know?

The Russians are doing everything possible and impossible to ensure that Neptune never deploys on combat duty. They are looking for the weak point of a unique rocket. ¬†But, as it turned out, it was Ukrainians who created the weakest spot of the Neptune project and the entire missile program.

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

**The remnants of Soviet SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles are stored at the Pavlohrad Chemical Plant. It's almost four dozen giant cylinders, each carrying 50 tonnes of fuel mixture. Boogeyman stories from time to time emerge on social networks, trying to frighten Pavlohrad residents with these missiles, saying that because of them the city's ecology is under constant threat. But the first thing that TSN.Tyzhden saw at the plant premises was wild animals. And they are just fine here. A short trip to see former nuclear missiles is like an exotic safari, reporters say.**

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

"But what's the connection between bison and missiles? These giants were not put here for fun. They are part of environmental monitoring. With the help of these animals, experts monitor pollution levels at the chemical plant," said TSN.Tyzhden's special correspondent Andriy Tsaplienko.

**It turns out that the old SS-24s are not some toxic waste, but a strategic resource. Pavlohrad Chemical Plant is the only facility in the world where new rocket fuel is created from the old one ‚Äì for new Ukrainian rockets and missiles. And this isn't just fuel. Neptune's warhead is also an upgrade of the old ones. Therefore, these metal cigars are the only source of fuel and warheads for the entire Ukrainian missile program. If this resource is gone, Ukraine will be left without Neptune.**

**"It's not only about Neptune‚Ä¶ We would be left with nothing ‚Äì without munitions, Vilkha, Neptune, and Typhoon," says CEO of SE Pavlohrad Chemical Plant, Leonid Shiman.**

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

**"Vilkha-M" is an MLR system that's been converted into high-precision weaponry. "Typhoon" is a new rocket to replace the obsolete "Grad". "Hrim-2" is an analog of the Russian "Iskander", being able to fly 280 km, while changing velocity and trajectory. At the same time, without own-made fuel, all these projects would die out.**

But the missile program suffered a high-precision blow from those who were supposed to protect it ‚Äì Ukrainian legislators. In the fall of 2019, the parliament, having approved the state budget, unexpectedly cut funding for the upgrade of the SS-24s. These intercontinental nuclear missiles had been based in Ukraine in Soviet times before being pulled out of 46 launch mines. There was no longer enough money even to maintain the Scalpels (that's their NATO codename). Ukraine had to put on the back shelf the idea of upgrading them and, therefore, producing strategic fuel. The Russians were about to pop champagne bottles as the entire Ukrainian missile program was on the verge of failure.

"I don't know if Russia could have meddled in this, but it would be truly beneficial for them. I think they were very happy because the weaker we are in military prowess and armaments, the easier it is to talk to us ‚Äì not only in Donbas or Minsk but also worldwide, "says Leonid Szyman.

üì∑Photo from UNIAN

When TSN.Tyzhden was setting off to Pavlograd, the team hadn't known yet that the national program in question has been rescued. The government urgently found a way to finance it, vowing readiness to inject more than UAH 130 million. So the missile program is back on track. The company says Ukraine is now able to manufacture an intermediate range missile, precisely the type the Soviets used to keep the U.S. anxious during the Cold War.

The Pavlograd Chemical Plant is convinced it will take 12 to 14 months to complete the project. If the government has enough political courage to take such a step, Ukraine will, if necessary, be able to hit military targets 5,000 km beyond its borders. That's even beyond the Ural ridge in Russia, which is a great deterrent to keep a raging adversary off. And Moscow's attempts to stop this sudden U-turn only confirm that Ukraine's strategy is legit.

"Small and intermediate-range missiles are more like weapons of strategic political influence. These weapons may never be used, but their availability allows our political leaders to gain more space in decision-making and discussing certain issues at summits with other countries. Ukraine will not be sitting somewhere in the backyard ‚Äì it will sit at the same table with leaders," said Yevhen Ustymenko, technical director at the Pavlograd Chemical Plant.

In other words, it is easier to persuade the occupier to cease fire with a kind word and a high-precision missile than with just a kind word. Such a path to peace is much shorter, global practice shows.

17527 Vengeance Strikes - Morning Summary May 1, 2023 as of 6:00a.m. PT

Since the evening, the information field has been preparing for retaliation strikes on infrastructure facilities, and at night they resumed. The air raid alert sounded at the beginning of the fifth night, there were reports of the launch of Russian missiles and the rise of Tu-95 bombers into the sky.

At the same time, appeals to local residents immediately began to accelerate on the network with a ban on the publication of information about arrivals, which, obviously, they planned in advance to pass off as "air defense work."

Explosions sounded in:

Kiev:

Dnepropetrovsk Dnepropetrovsk region:

Sumy region:

Pavlograd;

Kharkov region:

Ivano-Frankovsk region.

Non-standard this time is that at the moment, there has not been a single report of emergency power outages in any of the regions of Ukraine.

17574 RU pov Compilation of footage from Russian VDV soldiers during their various battles in Ukraine, mostly from summer and fall of 2022 (Music from Source) 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17575 The VDV is not only a great reminder of the cost of war itself, but also the reality that even the best trained forces can suffer insane losses. According to the creator of the "*Rybar"* Telegram channel, Mikhail Zvinchuk, [the VDV has lost about 40-50% of their personnel between February and September 2022](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-airborne-forces-lost-50-percent-personnel-1777937) (equals to about 22,500 dead from 45,000 total personnel). Russia officially claims to only have lost 1,700 VDV, but it needs to be said that officially Russia claims to only have lost about 6,000 personnel TOTAL in the same timeframe whilst western estimates come to a figure of about 100,000 dead.

&#x200B;

If that figure seems exceptionally high to some, please note that VDV troops have either been pretty much the tip of the spear of all the early attacks of the invasion or been deployed behind enemy lines like in Hostomel, Vasylkiv and Kharkiv (late Feb / early March 2022). One of the most prominent high ranking officers to have died in the war so far was Major General of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division [Andrei Sukhovetsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Sukhovetsky), appointed deputy commander of the 41st combined arms army during the invasion.

---------------------------

>Brief results of the second military April: 

>1) Bakhmut has not been ‚Äútortured‚Äù for a month, the enemy continues to defend on the western outskirts, solving the problem of holding out for a counteroffensive on one of the other (I suppose) fronts. "Wagner" is bloodless, its strike force (even with constant replenishment of volunteer units and "mobiles" from the Ministry of Defense) was not enough to complete the operation in April. The ‚ÄúBakhmut meat grinder‚Äù continues for both sides, but the enemy has solved his tasks, but our side has not.

> 2) Near Avdiivka, our troops failed and now - due to heavy losses - they are forced to retreat again, leaving part of their previously occupied positions. In Marinka, on the whole, without changes, the bloody street ‚Äúpush-pull‚Äù continued throughout April with varying success.

> On the other fronts, local battles were fought and artillery and air strikes were exchanged. The general conclusion is that the enemy again managed to carry out the April battles successfully for himself (as part of gaining time in the strategic defense). In May, the summer campaign and the ‚Äúgo after the Ukrainians‚Äù will begin, since our generals were unable to do almost anything during the winter and spring, except for the disposal of the shock corps in the Donbass.

17613 And the Ukrainian forces are now confined to an area of the city itself barely over 2km2, maybe less at this point. With the concentration of Russian artillery and firepower on such a small area, Ukrainian losses must be absolutely staggering, there's simply no way around it. In the same way Wagner casualties were massive when they only had a small foothold in the city the Ukrainians could focus on.

Prigozhin himself estimates over 500 casualties a day for the Ukrainians in Bahkmut, but "Prigozhin says he lost 94 KIA and inflicted 500 casualties on Ukrainian troops" doesn't have the same ring too it I suppose.

Both sides are bleeding heavy, but every day the counter-offensive is delayed is disastrous for the defenders and has been for awhile now, out of context Prigozhin quotes dont change this.

17631 UA POV Given the recent speech by Prigozhin, it is important to clarify the situation in Bakhmut. 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17632   **Tatarigami\_UA**  
 Given the recent speech by Prigozhin, it is important to clarify the situation in Bakhmut. Based on compiled information that I am allowed to publish, it is true that Wagner is responsible for assaults and advances in Bakhmut. So why do things look grim on their end? 

 Wagner convicts have limited value and only make advances when heavy artillery fire is present. If the artillery is suppressed or runs out of ammunition, they don't make progress. Unfortunately, the lack of ammunition on our side hinders counter-battery fire. 

 Serious tensions exist between Wagner and the Ministry of Defense. These tensions exist not only at the top level but also at the regular level. Some Wagner units act as policing forces, commit crimes, and openly disrespect military commanders with impunity. 

 Poor cooperation between Wagner and MoD results in a lack of coordination between them. The MoD only establishes control over territories captured by Wagner, while Wagner continues to assault forward without proper coordination. 

 The emergence of multiple "PMCs": Wagner, Potok, Veteran, Yenisey, Skif, Tigr, Irbis, Rys' and Wolves have created additional coordination complexities, including logistical challenges, a lack of clear command chains, and insufficient intelligence exchange and coordination.

  
  Example: A newly formed "Wolves" squad drove to Ukrainian lines without coordination, attempting to "gain reputation". However, due to their lack of knowledge about the area and the situation, they drove into a landmine and died. The wounded members had to be evacuated. 

 In Bakhmut, Wagner manages to move forward by turning defensive positions into rubble with intense artillery, mortar, TOS, and air support fire. They are also aware of the Ukrainian forces' lack of artillery ammunition and are not afraid of counter-battery fire. 

 However, Prigozhin himself admitted that without artillery ammo, Wagner is ineffective, and they can only move forward with huge losses that they cannot sustain. The MoD seems reluctant to provide more support, likely due to their fear of a counter-attack at any moment. 

  Without artillery superiority on the field, Wagner's tactics don't work and yield no results and lead to fruitless and unsustainable casualty ratios. We need much more ammo, artillery and other counter-battery means to nullify their assault capabilities. 

 Wagner troops lack both training and experience in preparing complex and organized defenses. Organizing defenses, establishing firing positions, and managing logistics in a well-structured manner is difficult, and Wagner is not designed or equipped for it. 

 While it's unclear if our command will decide to counter-attack in the area, it's quite possible that what russia was able to achieve in the course of 9 months will be reversed within a week and result in a breakthrough and encirclement of Horlivka and the rears of Donetsk. 

 While this is mere speculation on my part, considering the poor state of their troops in Bakhmut, launching a counter-offensive in this direction could cause a serious blow to russian morale. This is just one of many potential directions for such an attack.

17652 Here‚Äôs the real scoop folks. It turns out that this pro-Russian Ukrainian civilian was just out to clear his mind and relax. So he got his boat and went for a paddle. Not more than 10 mins out, he came under the shelling of Nazi Ukrainians, which he heroically deflected with his paddles and adopted Russian exceptionalism. But his paddles were not plated like the world beating t-14 armata, and were lost. Lack of control lead him into the reeds, where he came across the bodies of Ukrainian Nazis and their weapons. Subjected to disgusting truth of the Ukrainian regime, he vowed revenge for his paddles and took up the lost weapons. In only ten minutes, he came across the tenth armored kayaking brigade of the AFU, and opened fire. He sank them all, but his munition was spent, and he could not shoot down the Ukrainian drone that was all that was left of his enemy. You see the rest of what happened. He is a Hero. 

Yes, this is stupid, but so is most of everything else on this post.

17653  

First reports that he was hit by artillery but found more info on tl

"Few details. It was a Russian soldier who dressed in civilian clothes and tried to swim to one of the islands.

The thing is that there were 200s on the island, which have already been lying since January, and a person was sent to take their material for identification.

As a result, he was noticed by our drone, when he realized this, he asked by all means not to be killed and decided to swim to give up, but that's bad luck - he came across a mine along the way. He had at least 2 RPO "Bumblebee" with him." 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , comment
17654 I love how we all have access to HD Video of probably almost hundreds of drone recorded videos. 

As far as Intel collection, Ukraine has had a resounding success using drones for ISR. If you even for a second believe that this boat wasnt observed and confirmed multiple times over before a round was sent to his apparently 10 digit grid coordinate, you're reaching. 

EVEN THEN, you can't point to this one case and suddenly be like: "look! Ukrainians are killing civilians too" and use that to justify RU literally deleting cities and towns and PURPOSESLY targeting civilian buildings/apartment complexes. 

Am I saying Ukrainians haven't killed civilians in collateral damage? No, this is literally a war zone and that's unrealistic but it's still no where near the atrocious shit RU troops have been recorded doing to civilians. Stop with that shit and be rational. 

Same with the Nazi shit, are there Nazis in Ukraine? Sure. Are there also Nazis in literally every country? Yes. Does that justify violating the sovereignty of a country? Nah.

17674 After some research, this picture seems to be first seen on pro Russian twitter accounts. They don't list sources.

The picture quality is so bad you can't make out any faces. There are also no batches or other identification visible. However, the weapons carried seem to be a mix of  SVD, PKP, AKs, AR-15 and M16. A geolocation seems not possible.

While I have no doubt that there are Nazis in the Ukrainian military, I also have no doubt there is Russian propaganda pushing this narrative.

For this case it just can't be determined.

# Ukraine's Defence Intelligence advises residents of Crimea to stay away from military objects

**‚Äî** SATURDAY, 29 APRIL 2023 

 After a fire at an oil depot in Sevastopol, Ukraine‚Äôs Defence Intelligence recommends residents of occupied Crimea stay away from military facilities.

 **Source:** Andrii Yusov, representative of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine

**Details:** Ukraine‚Äôs Defence Intelligence clarified that the explosion at the Russian oil depot in occupied Sevastopol destroyed more than 10 tanks with oil products with a capacity of 40,000 tonnes.

As Yusov states, oil products were intended for the Black Sea Fleet of the aggressor state.

**Quote from Yusov:** "‚ÄòCotton‚Äô \[Russian propaganda, initially refusing to use the word ‚Äòvzryv‚Äô (explosion), used ‚Äòkhlopok‚Äô (a bang) instead. However, ‚Äòkhlopok‚Äô also means ‚Äòcotton‚Äô, and this has since become a meme - ed.\] in Sevastopol is God's punishment, in particular for the civilians killed in Uman, including five children. This punishment will be long-lasting.

It is advisable for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to stay near military facilities or facilities providing for the aggressor's army in the near future. "

**Background:** Mikhail Razvozhayev, the so-called "governor of Sevastopol", reported that a fuel storage tank was burning in Kozacha Bay, which he said was caused by a drone strike on the night of 29 April.

 "The ammo left is not for weeks, but for days. If the shortage of ammunition is not replenished, then we will either have to go out or stay to die. Most likely, we will be forced to withdraw some of the units \[from Bakhmut\]. And then everything else will fall apart"

17720 RU POV - aftermath of AFU shelling in Donetsk 
 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17721 The total number of civilian deaths in Ukraine between 2014 and 2021 is 3404. This includes all civilians, those living in the West, in the Donbas and those killed on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. 

The total number of civilian casualties recorded by OHCHR in 2021 was 110.

From 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation‚Äôs armed attack against Ukraine started, to 15 January 2023, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 18,358 civilian casualties in the country: 7,031 killed and 11,327 injured.

>https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/01/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-3-january-2023

>https://ukraine.un.org/en/168060-conflict-related-civilian-casualties-ukraine

So Russias invasion of Ukraine has in a single year killed more than double the number of civilians that died between 2014 -> Russian invasion. If you just look at 2021, then Russias invasion increased the number of civilian deaths by at least 70x year on year.

17745  üîª In Bakhmut, the Vagner PMC assault squads continue to advance in the central part of the city. Intense clashes are taking place in the garage cooperative, where the AFU is trying to counterattack.

‚ñ™Ô∏è To the north, the Wagner fighters have fully occupied the block on Oleg Koshevoy Street and are moving deeper along Oboronina and Pobedy Streets.

‚ñ™Ô∏è To the south, the Russian fighters entrenched on the territory of the medical college and completely cleared the Bakhmut industrial and vocational college on Tchaikovsky Street.

üîªDespite the huge losses, the command of the Soledar tactical group gave orders to hold the city. Reinforcements continue to be transferred to the combat area, and fighting continues north of Khromovo.

‚ñ™Ô∏è In Alekseevo-Druzhkivka there is active training of mobilized to supplement the 10th OgshbR and 28th Army Brigade of the AFU under the guidance of Polish instructors. The forces of the 28th Brigade must complete the replenishment by May 3, and the 10th Brigade by May 10.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The wounded are discharged from hospitals and hospitals in the occupied part of the DNR ahead of schedule to be sent to units on the front line. Only the 30th Brigade has lost more than 50% of its personnel killed during the fighting.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The reconnaissance unit "Eye" of the 1st rifle battalion of the 67th brigade, equipped with a radio-technical reconnaissance complex, was transferred to Chasov Yar.

17751 The video is very interesting because it shows almost the entirety of the new houses built by Russia in Mariupol (except for the 24th Mikroraion for some reason). Which in total is about an area of 0.5% of the city, probably less. For some reason they also included the last clip, although it only shows an abandoned construction project from 2014, somewhere west of the residential area Novoselivka. Russia wants to continue the construction, but as far as I know there are no concrete steps yet.

As the publication managed to find out, when forcing the Dnieper, the Armed Forces of Ukraine intend to use small operational special forces on kayaks. Since January, Ukraine has been buying special equipment for this and attracting experts.

One of the coaches is a German citizen. He said that he had trained about 40 Ukrainian soldiers.

Bild obtained photos from a training camp in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian special forces are being trained to paddle and disembark in full combat gear.

It is kayaks that are best suited for stealth approach to enemy positions on the opposite bank: they are silent and small in size, it is difficult to see them at night.

A special coating is applied to the board so that they cannot be detected by a night vision device.'

Earlier , he confirmed that, despite the damage, Artemovsk is subject to restoration."

17819 I have seen very little evidence that Russia targets civilian residences that have not been commandeered by Ukrainian soldiers. Usually these attacks involve Russian missiles diverted by S300 anti-air missiles, or the anti-air missiles themselves going off track or misdirecting. But hey, believe what you want.

edit - btw there **IS** a great deal of evidence that the Ukrainian soldiers indiscriminately shoot missiles into civilian areas of Donetsk city which contains Russian speaking Ukrainians, which they despise - and which they have also been doing for the last 9 years. So there's that.

17820 Based off the fact that Ukraine claims to have downed two missiles in the Cherkasy region, the logical conclusion is that this is the aftermath of an AA missile or the cruise missile after getting hit. Fortunately it looks like there were no casualties‚Ä¶miraculously.

&#x200B;

Original Telegram speech : t <dot> me/Prigozhin_hat/3195

&#x200B;

Key takeaways :

\- Priz thinks UA is ready and that the counteroffensive may start early May

\- He's very angry at the military command for the ammo/shell shortages and that they're not getting any successes on the other fronts while Wagner keeps AFU busy in Bakhmut

\- Wagner forces are depleting and can last 2-3 more weeks in these conditions

\- The casualties ratio is 1:5(!) ~~in favor of UA~~ but they're ready to fight "at any cost" to disrupt AFU

Edit: He probably meant that 5 times more than normal are dying during assaults because of the shell/ammo hunger.

The vast majority of new graves were from the AZOV battalion culling the Russian friendly population in revenge for Russia invading. AZOV refused to let the people evacuate then used them as human shields, shooting them if they tried to go outside. Not to mention starting fires with people still inside buildings, again shooting those who tried to escape. Their mission was to leave nothing of the city behind for the Russians except ruins filled with the dead and starving.

 Ukraine-Russia Combat Events , post
17962 Original, paywalled link: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-combat-vehicles.html

-------------------------

>Nearly all the combat vehicles Ukraine‚Äôs Western allies promised to deliver in time for Kyiv‚Äôs expected spring counteroffensive have arrived, NATO‚Äôs top military commander said on Wednesday.

>‚ÄúOver 98 percent of the combat vehicles are already there,‚Äù said the officer, Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, who is also the top commander of U.S. forces in Europe. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, he said, ‚ÄúI am very confident that we have delivered the mat√©riel that they need and we‚Äôll continue a pipeline to sustain their operations as well.‚Äù

>General Cavoli‚Äôs comments were his most expansive on the war in Ukraine and America‚Äôs military support of Kyiv since he assumed the European and NATO commands last year.

>The United States and NATO allies have supplied Ukraine with extensive artillery and ammunition for the long-heralded counteroffensive, and officials now say they are hopeful the supplies will last ‚Äî a change from two months ago, when they were only trickling in and U.S. officials were worried that they might run out.

>General Cavoli explained to lawmakers how the allies worked with Ukraine to determine their war needs.

>‚ÄúWe checked it a couple of times, and we gathered it from our allies, who were very generous, especially with regard to tanks and armored fighting vehicles. And we have been shipping it into the country,‚Äù General Cavoli said, adding, ‚ÄúThe Ukrainians are in a good position.‚Äù

>Asked why the Biden administration had not rushed the delivery of advanced U.S. fighter jets, like Air Force F-16s, to Ukraine, General Cavoli said that Ukrainian forces had other more urgent requirements for the offensive, which U.S. officials now expect to start as early as next month.

>Celeste A. Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told the lawmakers that advanced Western fighter aircraft ranked only ‚Äúabout eighth‚Äù on Ukraine‚Äôs priority list.

>She said officials focused on resources with the ‚Äúhighest priority capabilities, and that has been air defense, artillery and armor.‚Äù

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a timing issue,‚Äù Ms. Wallander added. ‚ÄúWhat do they require right now, which is what we‚Äôve been focused on for the battles that they‚Äôre facing. What can we deliver that will be timely and effective?‚Äù

>Ukraine shares few details of its operational planning with the United States, but the counteroffensive appears likely to unfold in the country‚Äôs south, including along Ukraine‚Äôs coastline on the Sea of Azov, near the Russian-occupied Crimea peninsula, American officials say.

>While Ukrainian officials have said that their goal is to break through dug-in Russian defenses and create a widespread collapse in Russia‚Äôs Army, American officials have assessed that the counteroffensive is unlikely to dramatically shift momentum in Ukraine‚Äôs favor.

>According to our information, the Slovenian government delivered 20 armored vehicles of the Pandur type to Ukraine in complete secrecy. Slovenian Valuks are armed with 40 mm automatic bomb launchers or 12.7 mm machine guns, and we had 85 of them in our composition and they were in the Slovenian Army for 24 years. These are the least old weapons that Slovenia sent to Ukraine, they are intended for the transport of infantry and protect them from anti-personnel mines and infantry weapons up to 12.7 mm caliber.

Curious if the 98% is of all vehicles, even the not publicly announced ones.

Situation at Bakhmut city: Russian Army broke the Ukrainian defense line of the big garage complex from the west and forced the Ukrainian Army to withdraw from most of the area. In addition, troops took full control over the Vodocanal district and reached the intersection of Chaikovskoho-Yuvileina streets, thus cutting one of the important supply routes of Ukrainian forces. Moreover, the frontline moved to the entirety of Polevja Street and Oleksandra Matrosova Street.

18006 That's a 10th Mountan Bd patch. They are currently not in Bakhmut, but in the salient to the north, near Bilohorivka, according to OSINT maps. If they push south from there, they would threaten the rear of Russian forces around Soledar and then Bakhmut.

So why haven't they done it yet? Either they don't have the capabilities; the ground is still too wet and the push is the surprise when it dries; or nothing is going to happen and it's all disinformation/trolling/clout chasing.
