They aimed at a museum, killing 2 women and injuring around 10 more people that were inside and/or near the building. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, which is probably the exact reason why they chose to hit it, so that they won’t hit anything military related by mistake.\n",

      "I almost forgot that 3 days ago was the 1-year anniversary since our apartment building was directly hit by a Grad missile. That was definitely one of the worst days of this war for us and our neighbors, pretty hard to believe that it has actually been that long, it feels like much less time has passed. It’s now also incomparably more peaceful here in the city, even counting the occasional missile strikes it almost feels like there’s no war at all when comparing the current situation to the first few months of the war with the constant shelling.\n",

      "Mr Yusov described the blast as \"God's punishment\" for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. \n",

      "The last 3 days were mostly quiet, there were no new missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv after the pervious strike from a couple of days ago, though sadly they still used S-300 missiles to hit Kupiansk yesterday. They aimed at a museum, killing 2 women and injuring around 10 more people that were inside and/or near the building. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, which is probably the exact reason why they chose to hit it, so that they won’t hit anything military related by mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost forgot that 3 days ago was the 1-year anniversary since our apartment building was directly hit by a Grad missile. That was definitely one of the worst days of this war for us and our neighbors, pretty hard to believe that it has actually been that long, it feels like much less time has passed. It’s now also incomparably more peaceful here in the city, even counting the occasional missile strikes it almost feels like there’s no war at all when comparing the current situation to the first few months of the war with the constant shelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there are some pretty funny, but also very concerning reports coming from people living in Izyum about crows/ravens that take mines and spread them in previously demined places. Not sure if there are any officially confirmed cases of it happening, but the “petal” anti-personnel mines only weigh 80 grams so a crow could probably carry and drop them in some random places. Crows bombarding our cities with AP mines is definitely not something I thought we would need to worry about.\n",

      "\n",
      "> Brief summary of the second wartime April: \n",
      "\n",
      "> 1) In the last month the battle for Bakhmut has failed to be \"excruciatingly won\", the enemy continues to defend on the western outskirts, determined to hold out until a counteroffensive on some other (I guess) front. \"Wagner\" has been bled dry, its assault force (even with constant reinforcement by volunteer units and \"mobiks\" from the MoD) was not enough to complete the operation in April. The \"Bakhmut meat grinder\" continues for both sides, but the enemy has achieved their goals, while our side has not. \n",
      "\n",
      "> 2) Near Avdiivka, our forces have failed and are now - due to heavy losses - forced to pull back again, leaving some of the positions they had previously occupied. In Maryinka - largely no changes - bloody \"tug-of-war\" street fighting continued throughout April, with variable success. On the other fronts, there were local battles and exchanges of artillery and air strikes. \n",
      "\n",
      "> The overall conclusion is that the April battles were again broadly successful for the enemy (in the context of buying time in strategic defence). In May the summer campaign will start and the \"turn for the Ukrainians\" will begin, as our generals managed to achieve virtually nothing over the winter and spring except the disposal of the shock troops in the Donbass. \n",

Aligning the front line is very difficult for Russians, so they stick forward between everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "> The central part - the situation is actually shit, because the enemy is pressing without even wanting to slow down, the intensity of line changes is simply crazy, then they moved forward a little, then back and so on around the clock, but we are simply being bombarded with meat, which even I don't think is very good, who understands where we got to at this stage. Polyova street came under the full control of the Russians at night, the defense is partial on Pushkina street, but the boys will be taken out from there, maintenance is not realistic in that area. \n",

      "> The Khromove track is a fierce battle, the guys are on the defensive, there were about 10+ attempts to advance during the night, well, nothing yet. \n",

      "> Conclusion: as I said, the enemy accumulated a lot of forces while conducting combat reconnaissance (about two weeks ago) when there were almost no changes in the territory, but there were many counterattacks from our side, the guys were incited, from Syria and Africa (this is about the PKV) they launched assaults, drove the mobilized to the flanks for containment, and began to simply push us out of the city. \n",

We are literally being pushed out of town. And looking at the situation, we begin to understand what to do against a pile of meat that storms you from groups of 30-40 people, then there are storming groups that are already training, and what can I say, even prisoners recruited by this private mercenary, who by some miracle are still alive, already know how to fight well, because the best skills come in practice. \n",

The Rybar channel writes that Geran-2 drones were launched in the city - this is how the Iranian Shahed 136 drones are called in the Russian army, as well as tactical aviation missiles. On Russian TV channels, they said that in Pavlograd \"the Armed Forces of Ukraine were methodically pulling together air defense systems for a counteroffensive.\"\n",

      "▪️In recent days, Ukrainian officials have been regularly talking about the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a counteroffensive. Last week, Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said that the troops were waiting for the decision of the command to launch an offensive: “We received very modern weapons <…> As soon as God’s will, the weather and the decision of the commanders, we will do it.” Christopher Cavoli, Commander-in-Chief of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe, said on Thursday that the allies had transferred more than 98% of the promised combat vehicles to Ukraine.\n",
